### Story

Education is strongest when it embraces individuals diversity. Everyone should get equal educational opportunities of participation to quality education. Inclusion could make it possible - however, we should talk about this idea regarding to the complexity of societies.

__Chapter 1:__ 
Given the fact of continuous development, social structures and global influences determine inclusion and inclusive education in societies; this frame influences institutions, interactions as well as perceptions and identities of groups and individuals. With regard to the aim of inclusion and quality education, we should look on the individuum in the middle of each society. Furthermore, we should look on the everyday interactions in our next socioecological environments, and get in our mind that everyone is responsible in thinking and acting inclusive.

__Chapter 2:__ People are different in various dimensions of social, biological and psychological characteristics; they also act differently with and among each other. This can lead to discriminatory situations. Looking on the historical development of diversity as well as inclusion and their definitions (also problems of finding a value-free description of the phenomenons), we see changing terms / concepts (e.g. diversity; integration and inclusion). Some researchers are talking about a paradigm shift in modern society.

__Chapter 3:__ With the help of global cooperation, international legal frameworks (e.g., the human rights convention) and national rights (e.g, in Germany, the „Übereinkommen über die Rechte von Menschen mit Behinderungen“ in 2009) have been agreed over time to ensure that people can live together in societies without discrimination. Looking to the future, the SDGs show shared visions and common goals for inclusion as a sociopolitical process and the well-being of all generations.

__Chapter 4:__ Educational institutions should ensure that individuals (children, pupils/students and teachers as well as other adults who participate) are aware of the global values and inclusive objectives, so that they can put them into practice. For this, social institutions need a quality framework (e.g. in the school system, multi-professional teams, team teaching and integrative approaches)

__Chapter 5:__ Teachers must be able to respond to the different needs and requirements of each individual pupil / student. To do this, they must be sensitised to the various dimensions of diversity (social-cultural, biological-physical, and psyche-emotional). Furthermore, they must get to know how to re-act in inclusive lessons, try what makes quality inclusion possible and reflect with colleagues in the schooling context and with other professionals.

__Chapter 6:__ The human species benefits from a foundation of specific cognitive abilities. However, this also means that individuals are influenced by unconscious biases that guide life through thought and action - for example, teachers who should deal fairly with special educational needs or migration.

The European University for Well-Being (EUniWell) is a joint project funded by the European Union. 

__EUniWell unites [eleven European universities](https://www.euniwell.eu/about/universities) with the aim of improving the well-being and quality of life for European citizens.__

Why Well-Being?
---

EUniWell's approach aligns with the Council of the European Union's call for a knowledge-based strategy to advance the 'Economy of Wellbeing,' promoting synergies between society, science, and the environment. Despite high life expectancies and human development in Europe, the well-being of youth is threatened by challenges like climate change, new diseases, rising populism, societal divides, and war. Addressing these issues requires a holistic approach where higher education, research, and innovation play crucial roles. EUniWell aims to foster well-being through research, education, and civic engagement, shaping policies and pedagogy to enhance skills development and improve the quality of life for European citizens.[^1]

> __Aim of EUniWell__
> 
> "Based on our joint values – democratic, inclusive, diverse, research and challenge-based, inter- and transdisciplinary, entrepreneurial, and co-creational – we aim to develop an action-oriented response to well-being, grounded in high profile research expertise, educational leadership and civic engagement. EUniWell aims to play a critical, intermediary role in shaping research-based policy and pedagogy to inform decision-making, underpin skills development, and realise a measurable impact on our students’ learning experience and European citizens’ quality of life."[^2]

Systemic approach
---

EUniWells five thematic arenas enable a multifaceted and multicultural approach to addressing well-being, leveraging the diverse strengths and expertise of the project members. EUniWell's vision emphasizes viewing these dimensions from a systemic and global perspective rather than a purely individual one.

Arena 5: Teacher Education and Well-Being
---

The Teacher Education Arena is driven by the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) „Quality Education“ (SDG 4), which converges many societal needs addressed by other SDGs (e.g. SDG 5 „Gender Equality“, SDG 10 „Reduced Inequality“). Its mission is to promote well-being in the school and educational context on an individual, societal and international level, in collaboration with its many educational and civic actors. The education and training of (future) teachers and students is one of the pressing challenges and responsibilities of the 21st century. The design of compassionate and vivid school communities, learning environments, and teaching pedagogies plays an important role as a societal vanguard for our democratic systems and values and the European future heritage. 

What we do
--- 

EUniWell aims to increase the attractiveness and the recognition of the teaching profession, the social value of education, and the co-creation of communities of well-being in schools. This will be achieved through the development and dissemination of joint interdisciplinary research, innovative quality education and professional training programmes, the linking of school networks, and the involvement of societal stakeholders. This arena aims to prepare, support, and strengthen our teachers for the current challenges they face in our classrooms and societies. We follow a holistic and low hierarchical approach, bringing together different expertise, perspectives, systems, and structures. We emphasise the necessity of an international, transversal curriculum based on core issues in teacher education such as inclusion and diversity, guidance, sustainability, digitalisation, democracy, and health: defining and developing key-skills for the teaching profession. We are inspired to tackle the phenomena and realities of the 21st century by looking at what lies ahead, across the European continent and worldwide.
What we currently focus on 

In Arena 5, our objectives are centred around four key areas:
---

* __Innovative research:__ Advancing trans-institutional research in the area of teacher education and well-being. Analysing new educational and pedagogical affordances, defining diverse professional skills and training needs, especially for second career teachers. Exploring innovative approaches and training. 

* __Teacher education programs and educational offers:__ Developing academic content and supporting training offers focused on professionalisation of teaching, lifelong learning, and future skills, especially in the area of multilingualism and cultural competences. Defining and expanding a common guiding framework based on professional standards elaborated during EUniWell‘s pilot phase. Creating open educational resources (OERs), online and hybrid training modules and courses (particularly for cross-cutting topics such as diversity and inclusion, social media and digital literacy).

* __Collaboration and networking:__ Facilitating knowledge exchange and networking opportunities for actors of all career phases according to their specific needs. Connecting local schools by expanding the European School Network established during EUniWell‘s pilot phase, bringing together teacher educators, students and civic stakeholders. Organising international conferences and lecture series addressing current and future challenges encountered by teachers and educators.

* __Community engagement:__ Linking theoretical and practical knowledge transfer locally and globally. Creating international mobility experiences for teacher students, e.g. by promoting internships to foster a global sense of community through the experience of a local sense of belonging. Developing regionally-based training pacts to tackle international questions with local solutions.

### Definition of Professional Teacher Standards

One of the key foci during EUniWell´s pilot phase (2019-2023) was the definition of competence areas and professional standards in order to elaborate a transversal curriculum for European teacher education.

Based on literature and on the survey comparison of professional standard frameworks per country, the Teacher Education Arena identified four competence areas.

1. Guidance
2. Inclusion
3. Sustainability
4. Health care

For each area, __professional standards__ have been identified and articulated into __sub-professional standards__, and the related __professional behaviours__ expected by teachers of the future.

Professional Standards for Inclusion
------

The notion of inclusion refers both to an ideological stance and a way of designing education. 

When referring to the design of education, inclusion implies a classroom where the diversity of students is acknowledged in that all students are provided with a meaningful education (Florian, 2017[^1]; Popkewitz, 2004[^2]). Thus, an inclusive classroom holds a diversity of students where inclusion regards social, spatial, and didactical aspects of education (Asp-Onsjö, 2006[^3]).

* The teacher is knowledgeable and confident in implementing research-based inclusive education.
* The teacher is able to plan and adapt differentiated education, respecting the different needs of students.
* The teacher promotes supportive education, aiming at fostering independent, self-confident, and critical learners.

Inclusion and education

Watch the 2020 UNESCO Global education monitoring report on inclusion and education video. 

This video provides an overview of how education that is not inclusive affects children and what can be done to promote change and to ensure that all children have access to an inclusive and equitable quality education.

Intro:

Everyone is different. 
The 2020 Global Education monitoring report on inclusion and education believes that education is strongest when it embraces diversity. Learners should not have to adapt to the system, instead education systems should adapt to their needs. 
When students do not feel welcome in school, they are less likely to learn. This is everyone's loss. But rich and poor countries too often educate some children apart. Children who have a disability have been displaced, speak a different language, or are poor and disadvantaged. 

Problems:

School design may favor some students over others, as do many laws and policies. Teachers are often ill-equipped to cater for students diverse needs. Children may not recognize the way they are portrayed in textbooks. Some may not see themselves there at all. They receive the message that they do not belong. Testing sometimes follows a narrow vision of education and consequently some students leave education earlier than they should. These are complex problems to solve but a belief in the right to education is a belief in inclusion. Children have different learning speeds and needs. They need curricula that are flexible, creative and relevant. 
How we prepare teachers matters. They must be given the tools and training to achieve our vision for reform. The resources we know can help the marginalized. Educators, support stuff and equipment should be shared so that everyone can benefit. Better data on those left behind will help us reach them. Disadvantages often accumulate. We can't address inclusion one group at a time. 

Conclusion:

Redressing these disadvantages requires funds. These must be equitable and target individual specific needs. We must work together on these tasks across government ministries, from central to local authorities with civil society supporting governments and schools opening doors to the community. Inclusion in education requires a change in mindset in society, so that education for all means education for everyone without an exception. Achieving this is everybody's business including yours.

### Core Values and Competence Areas of Inclusive Teaching

"An important element of inclusive education involves ensuring that all teachers are prepared to teach 
all students. Inclusion cannot be realized unless teachers are empowered agents of change, with values, 
knowledge and attitudes that permit every student to succeed. Despite their differences in teacher 
standards and qualifications, education systems are increasingly moving away from identifying problems 
with learners and towards identifying barriers to learning. To complete this shift, education systems 
must design teacher education and professional learning opportunities that dispel entrenched views that 
some students are deficient, unable to learn or incapable."[^1]

## 1. System-Theoretical Perspectives

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/1-system-theory.png)

In order to understand the central topics of diversity and inclusion in general and in particular, as well as social facts and processes, we begin with selected theories and models from the educational and social sciences. References to school theory are highlighted and concrete examples of teacher professionalization are explained.

> __Learning Goals__
>
> * You are able to describe the significance of inclusive education and its impact on society.
> * You are able to explain the application of systems theory to the school system (including multi-level and ecosystemic models). 
> * You are able to describe how symbolic interactionism explains social behaviors related to inclusion. 


### 1.1 Social Systems Interaction - Politics, Economy & Education

The following sociological model "Social Subsystems" by Fend (2009)[^1] represents a  structural-functionalist perspective. It forms the basis of school theory and depicts society in its three major systems in abstract terms. The decisive factors here are the interrelationships and the fact that school is located as an institution.

The model shows that the socialization order of a society can be characterized by the three subsystems of politics, economics and education.

* The _political system_ sets the framework conditions for the other two systems. 

* The _economic system_ organizes work and the production and distribution of goods.

* The __education system__ organizes the production of qualifications and mental infrastructures.

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/3systems.png "Graphic: Fend (2009) p.36" )

Inclusion as a special phenomenon in current society
---

Lets imagine inclusion at the center of this social systemic model.

Initiated by political guidelines and recommendations, all other systems are called upon to engage with the establishment of inclusive development in the sense of progressive, sustainable modernization.

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/3systems-inclusion.png)

With regard to the education system, schools as institutions have the task of 

1. ensuring inclusion

2. further developing inclusion

Last but not least, inclusion is about the individual in society. In the education system  this concerns students, teachers, parents and the school management.

In the next chapter

To illustrate the position of the individual within social structures, we use Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological model.

### 1.2 Bronfenbrenners Ecological Systems Theory

Uri Bronfenbrenners Ecological Systems Theory posits that human development is influenced by the interactions between an individuals and their multiple environmental systems. (Bronfenbrenner 1977[^1]) These systems are nested within each other, each layer representing a different level of influence. 

!?[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6pUQ4EDHeQ)

<details>

<summary>~~**Click here to show the video transcript**~~</summary>

In 1964, a young psychologist appeared before the US congress with a mission.
It was a time when most people thought that the reason poor people stayed poor was a matter of biology 
and had nothing to do with the environment they grew up in.

The psychologist, Uri Bronfenbrenner, wanted to change that and convince the world that to help those less fortunate, we also need to
change their surroundings. But did he succeed?

Bronfenbrenner's Ecological System Theory conceives that a child is influenced by five ecological forces.

First comes the microsystem of family and friends that affect the child directly.
Second are the forces of the connections between the people around the child:parents with teachers and teachers with peers.

Then there are links between social settings that do not directly involve the child,such as the father with his boss,the peers with
their parents and the teacher with the principal. 

Next, is the overarching culture, religion and social norms that influences all others. 
And lastly, there is time - which changes everything over the course of one’s life.

Children are born into a Microsystem that influences the child's experiences directly.

Children from unfortunate backgrounds are more likely to experience problematic family structures 
-even if it’s simply for the fact that parenting is more difficult if you are poor.

They also encounter more negative situations at school or bad influences through friends.

Consequently, a child that grows up in a negative microsystem,will find it hard to succeed. 

The Mesosystem represents the interconnections between the elements that surround the child. 
For example the relationship between the father and the school teachers.

If the father doesn’t get along with a teacher,the child might suffer.

The EXOSYSTEM involves links between social settings that do not involve the child.

For example, a child's experience at home can be influenced by their parent's experiences at work.

If the mother loses her job, there might be more arguments with the father,resulting in changes in their interaction with the child.

The MACROSYSTEMdescribes the overarching culture that influences all other systems,such as a child’s geographic location and ethnicity.

Intelligent people who happen to live in bad places are more likely to move to better ones.

But that also means that they are more likely to be strangers in a richer society.

So regardless of the child’s biological potential or upbringing, on a macro level he or she may still be at a disadvantage.

The CHRONOSYSTEM,refers to changes in the child,and the environment over time.

As the child grows up the parents may stop loving each other and divorce, which can be traumatic for an eight year old boy.Five years later,
he may have come to terms with how things turned out.But when the boy turns 16, his mom’s new boyfriend moves into their tiny 
apartment, and things get difficult again.

Bronfenbrenner, who was influenced by Lev Vygotsky and Kurt Lewin, convinced the US congress that a child’s prospect is not
genetically predestined,but is the result of the larger environment they happen to be placed in.

Children who grow up in unfortunate social structures therefore need a form of support that not only reaches their families,but also
elements of their community. 

Bronfenbrenner's theory helped form the Head Start program in 1965,a government program that has served more than 35 million poor children since. 

Decades later, Bronfenbrenner and Stephen Ceciproposed an extension of this theory, called the "bioecological model".

This new model recognizes gene–environment interactions and acknowledges the role of heritability, but adds that genes themselve are under the
influence of the environment.

In other words, the process of heritability varies in a magnitude of potentials.

How much a child can make of the potential they inherit,depends on the ecological environment.

Bronfenbrenner made a critical contribution to our realization that parent-child relationships do not exist in a social vacuum but are embedded
in the larger structures, such as community, society, and culture.

In order to develop well, he allegedly said, “every child needs at least one adult who is irrationally crazy about him or her.”

Now it’s your turn,make five circles, draw yourself in the center and add a timeline at the bottom. Then add all the people, institutions and forces that affect your life.

On the timeline below you can add some major events from the past and those you expect in the future.

Can you tell how the 5 forces are shaping your life?

Microsystem
-----
"The microsystem encompasses all those factors that are attributed to an individual and their  actions by another individual, i.e. certain external characteristics, abilities, etc. These are personal influencing variables that are localised in the individual (SEIFERT 2011, S.115f.)"     quoted from Epp (2017)[^2]. 

Mesosystem
-----
_"The mesosystem "comprises the interrelationships between the areas of life in which the developing person is actively involved (for a child, for example, the relationship between home, school and group of mates; for an adult, the relationship between family, work and circle of acquaintances)" (BRONFENBRENNER 1981, p.41). Accordingly, the various life contexts in which an individual moves belong to the mesosystem (SEIFERT 2011, S.118)"_ quoted from Epp (2017)[^2].

Exeosystem
-----
_"An exosystem is understood to be areas "in which the developing person is not personally involved, but in which events take place that influence or are influenced by what happens in their area of life" (BRONFENBRENNER 1981, p.42). This includes formal and informal social structures, [...] This includes the larger institutions of society - not only those that are systematically structured, but also those that arise spontaneously - and how these unfold at the concrete local level (BRONFENBRENNER 1978,S.36)"_ quoted from Epp (2017)[^2].

Makrosystem
---
_"The concept of the macrosystem "refers to the fundamental similarity in form and content of the lower-order systems (micro-, meso- and exo-) that exist or could exist in the subculture or the entire culture, including their underlying worldviews and ideologies" (BRONFENBRENNER 1981, p.42). [...] which permeate society as a whole. This includes, for example, political, economic, social, legal or educational patterns (BRONFENBRENNER 1978, p.36)"_. quoted from Epp (2017)[^2]

![The ecosystemic development model](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/bronfenbrenner-epp.png "The ecosystemic development model according to Epp (2017)[^2] - translated from German")


By understanding these layers of influence, educators can be sensitised to create more inclusive and diverse educational environments.

Given the interactions and influence of individual thought structures in relation to inclusion in this complex framework, we will consider the level of interaction between two individuals. The theory of sysmbolic interactionism will help us to understand how new meanings and thought structures can emerge from interactions.

### 1.3 Symbolic Interactionism Theory

In his identity theory Mead distinguishes three concepts of the individual: I, ME & SELF.

* __I__

   Mead understands the "I" as a psychological component. This is where people's creative and impulsive emotions and actions occur. 

* __ME__

  The "Me" is the social component and the objective part of the person. It is shaped by the respective society and comes into conflict with external expectations and attitudes of other people.

* __SELF__
  
  The "Self" arises from the interaction between Me and I and develops from processes of experience and development. 
  
  The Self is not a fixed construct and continues to develop in the process.

  The Self reflects a person's self-perception and self-image.

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/i-me-self.png "Individuum: I, ME & SELF., own illustration")

Based on the descriptions and theoretical considerations, we can deduce that inclusive attitudes and the sense of belonging they create are also ongoing social-systemic and individual developments. In social interactions, we can actively shape inclusion and reflect on our own inclusive attitude.

The following model, based on the idea of symbolic interactionism theory (Mead,1986 see also Joas,1989;Helle,2001)[^1] shows how inclusion can arise from social interactions and result in an individual attitude.

## 2. Diversity & Inclusion - Two terms in flux

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/flux.png)

This chapter looks at the definitions of diversity and inclusion. From a SOCIAL-historical perspective, we take a closer look at conceptual changes and differences of exclusion, separation, integration, and inclusion in education. With regard to actual recognition of diversity, we also take a closer look on the term discrimination as the opposite of inclusion.

> __Learning Goal__
>
> * You are able describe basic definitions of "diversity", „inclusion“ and to deliniate related concepts such as exclusion, separation and integration.
> * You are able to describe forms of discrimination.

### 2.1 Definitions of Diversity and Inclusion

The current concepts are subject to the current problem that there is no standardised definition. Due to the orientation of this OER, we are working on the following book chapters / articles: 

* Walgenbach (2021)[^1] and Bührmann (2018)[^2] for the term of diversity.
* Cramer and Harant (2014)[^3] and Stichweh (2007)[^4] for the term of inclusion.

These articles provide a value-free definition of diversity on the one hand and a sociological definition of inclusion on the other.

> __Definition of Diversity__
>
> We define diversity as social fact that reflects the variety and difference of individuals in a society. The variety and difference is reflected on three levels. 1 social, 2. biological, 3. psychological-emotional.

> __Definition of Inclusion__
>
> Stichweh (2007, p. 113) distinguishes between three contexts of origin: __1.__ sociological systems theory - this speaks of inclusion and exclusion by analysing the form of participation and consideration of people in social systems; __2.__ French social theory, which since Durkheim has almost united the concept of inclusion with that of solidarity in a society. Inclusion and exclusion then signify the success or failure of solidarity; __3.__ British welfare state theory, which conceptualises the communicative consideration of people in social systems as membership according to the paradigm of citizenship.

### 2.3 Discrimination - What does it mean?

Einführung

!?[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRZPw-9sJtQ)

> __A Definition of Discrimination__
>
> "treating a person or particular group of people differently, especially in a worse way from the way in which you treat other people, because of their race, gender, sexuality, etc."[^1]

> __A Definition of Discrimination__
> 
> To discriminate (Latin: discriminare) means to distinguish, separate, segregate. In social science and political discussion, discrimination refers to disadvantages identified on the basis of group-specific differences in accordance with the principles of equality and equal treatment. Examples include gender, social origin, nationality, ethnic origin, skin color, language, religion and ideology, political beliefs, age, health, sexual orientation and sexual identity. Discrimination takes place in many areas of everyday life: Housing, education, the employment system, health and social services, policing, the administration of justice, representation in the media and political participation. Catalogs of characteristics and places of discrimination are open-ended, as new sensitivities to discriminatory practices, which then need to be addressed politically, emerge in the effort to realize equality.[^2]

Forms of discrimination
---
* Direct discrimination
* Indirect discrimination
* Harassment
* Bullying
* (Multiple discrimination or multidimensional discrimination)
* Intersectional deiscrimination

Following the definition, we would like to add that since the UN Convention, "people with disabilities" should be explicitly added to dictionary contributions. Age could also be recorded; the relevance is reflected, for example, in the educational science discussion of children's rights and in the debate about when young people are allowed to vote politically. People in nursing homes (Pflegeheimen?) also often experience discrimination.  (QUELLEN liefere ich nach)

Please, think about your own biographie and current life remembering: Where have I experienced discrimination myself in my childhood as a student?
Is there any current situation in my social or physical environment where I am confronted with discrimination in the narrow or broad sense? Feel free to note your own definition of discrimination according to the current situation - even if it is not you who is affected, but another person in your environment.

#### Deutsch

Diskriminieren (lat.: diskriminare) heißt unterscheiden, trennen, absondern. In der sozialwissenschaftlichen und politischen Diskussion bezeichnet Diskriminierung nach Grundsätzen der Gleichheit und Gleichbehandlung festgestellte Benachteiligungen aufgrund gruppenspezifischer Differenzen. Beispiele sind das Geschlecht, soziale Herkunft, Nationalität, ethnische Herkunft, Hautfarbe, Sprache, Religion und Weltanschauung, politische Überzeugung, Alter, Gesundheit, sexuelle Orientierung und sexuelle Identität. Diskriminierung findet in vielen Bereichen des Alltagslebens statt: Wohnen, Bildung, Beschäftigungssystem, Gesundheits- und soziale Dienste, Polizei, Rechtssprechung, Repräsentation in den Medien und politische Partizipation. Kataloge von Merkmalen und Orten der Diskriminierung sind unabgeschlossen, da im Bemühen um die Verwirklichung von Gleichheit neue Sensibilitäten für diskriminierende Praktiken, die es dann politisch zu adressieren gilt, entstehen. https://heimatkunde.boell.de/de/2008/02/18/institutionelle-diskriminierung-im-bildungs-und-erziehungssystem-theorie

### 2.4 Excerice: What means Inclusive Education?
-------------------

_"____Inclusive education____ is differentiated from ____“integration,”____ which was identified with the late 1970s and 1980s advocacy movement to educate students with developmental disabilities in regular schools—albeit in self-contained classrooms—rather than in special education schools with little or no contact with general education students, settings, or curricula (Sailor et al., 1989) and from ____“mainstreaming,”____ in which students with disabilities are  members of special education classes but “visit” general education classes to engage in educational and social  activities with same-age general education peers (Halvorsen & Neary, 2001; Sailor, 1991). Unlike integrated or mainstreamed students, students who receive inclusive educational services are ____members____ of the general education  classroom community. According to Halvorsen and Neary (2001), “the single most identifiable characteristic of  inclusive education is membership. Students who happen to have disabilities are seen first as kids who are a natural part of the school and the age-appropriate general education classroom they attend” (p.3)"_ quoted from (Hunt & McDonnall, 2007, S. 270)[^1], own highlighted keywords.

Watch the following video to get an understanding of the differences between integration, perceived inclusion and true inclusion.

Pay attention on the following:

* How homogeneous and heterogeneous is the class community portrayed?
* Observe who is located and moves where in the classroom?
* Who interacts with whom and how?
* What impressions, feelings and wishes does the narrator describe?


!?[What Is Inclusion?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VMz06iVzqs&t=32s)


<details>

<summary>~~**Click here to show the video transcript**~~</summary>

Integration

I don't understand why I'm at the back  f the class. I wish I was like everyone else. I want to do what they are doing. But here I am doing this a same old number activity watching as my classmates learn something else. Don't they know that they're setting me up to fail? Don't they know they hold my future in their hands? I want to work in my class, learn what they are learning and do the activities they do. But here I am stuck at the back, limited by low expectations. Having a one-on-one teacher aide just teaches me to rely on them and means I get less attention from the teacher. I'm not included in the classroom, I am in the same room but segregated from my peers, sat to the side or back working on different things and missing out. I want to be free to learn with my peers reach my full potential and be seen to be like everyone else. I need something to change. 

Perceived inclusion

You may be wondering what was wrong with this picture? I'm in the classroom with my peers, sitting on my seat, learning the same things as everyone else. You may think this is inclusion, but it's not. I am stifled, limited and held back from reaching my full potential. Though I love my teacher aid, I don't get to think for myself. In fact a lot of the time my teacher aid does it for me, even whispering the answer in my ear when I already know it. The more she is with me the more I realized that there is no point in me thinking for myself because she would give me the answer anyway. I'm sure there are other kids who also need to her help, does she need to be with just me? Can´t she help others? Surely If I need help I can put my hand up and ask my teacher like my friends do. My friends and classmates want to help me but by having someone right next to me they can't. I need to learn from my peers, be able to do group work and be challenged. I want to be allowed to fail or succeed and learn from it. I need something to change. 

Inclusion

Can you find me in the crowd? Inclusion is more than just a word. It is a culture, a mindset and an expectation that everyone can and will learn and succeed along their age-appropriate peers. I know it can be challenging to include me in the learning as sometimes I might require extra resources and information but giving me space to learn from my teacher and peers is the best way to challenge me and allow me to grow. I want to learn the same things as my classmates and I want teachers to have the same expectations of me as my friends. Mmy learning may need to be modified by I still want the opportunity to show what I can do, not focus on what I can't. Treat me the same as any other student and watch me flourish. I will rise to the challenge of expectations you set for me. Are you ready to really include me?

## 3. Legal Foundations & Historical Milestones for Inclusion.

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/human-rights.png)

Inclusion is a historically evolved concept whose basic idea is anchored in human rights.

Its establishment in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is based on a fundamental human rights-based understanding of disability, has contributed to its general dissemination.

Subsequently, the concept of inclusion was partly detached from its reference to people with disabilities and became a general principle for dealing with diversity in society. The perception of the increasing divide between people in different socio-economic situations, gender issues, generational conflicts and the challenges of cultural and religious diversity in the face of increased migration also came into focus.

> __Learning Goals__
>
> * You are able to describe the significance of international treaties and their implications for inclusion in education.

###	3.1 From Human Rights to Global Sustainability Goals.

Overview
-------

International legal treaties and frameworks play a crucial role in advancing global standards for human rights and inclusion and diversity in education.

Among the most influential are the [1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](#25), the [1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)](#26). Together they formed the bedrock of international human rights law, also emphasizing the universal right to education.

The [1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)](#27) further underscored the specific needs and rights of children, advocating for their right to receive education in a manner that respects their inherent dignity and promoted their overall development. Complementing these frameworks, the [Salamanca Statement adopted in 1994](#28), called for inclusive education systems that accommodate all children, regardless of their physical, intellectual, social, emotional, linguistic, or other conditions.

In addition, the [2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](#29) strengthened the commitment to inclusion by emphasizing the right of persons with disabilities to access quality education without discrimination and on an equal basis with others. This Convention has been instrumental in shifting perspectives towards a more inclusive and equitable approach to education.

The [Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDGs)](#30) established in 2015, particularly Goal 4.5 which aims to eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education for the vulnerable provided a comprehensive roadmap for global education development.

Together, these international legal instruments and goals compel governments and educational institutions to recognize and address the diverse needs of all learners.

### 3.2 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) 1948

Where do human rights begin?
----------------------------
At the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948, Eleanor Roosevelt, the first Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights and co-author of the Declaration of Human Rights, said:

> Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world. Yet they are the world of the individual person: the neighborhood he lives in; the school or college he attends; the factory, farm or office where he works. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world.
>
> -- Eleanor Roosevelt, Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights [^1]

The [Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, was the first legal document to set out the fundamental human rights to be universally protected. Although not legally binding, the [30 articles](http://www.standup4humanrights.org/en/declaration.html) of the declaration became moral and political guidelines which would profoundly influence the development of international human rights law.

The following articles are particularly relevant to diversity, inclusion and education
---

* __Article 1 - Free and equal__
  
  Establishes the fundamental principle of equality that underpins diversity and inclusion.
 
+ __Article 2 - Freedom from discrimination__

   Ensures that claiming the rights and freedoms of this declaration is available to everyone without discrimination.
 
* __Article 19 - Freedom of Expression__

   Supports the essential building blocks for diversity and inclusion by ensuring an open exchange of ideas, advocacy for inclusion, access to information, public discourse, academic freedom, and student participation.
 
* __Article 20 - Freedom of assembly__
   
   Protects diversity and inclusion by ensuring that people can freely associate with others who share their interests, beliefs, or goals, while also protecting them from forced association.
 
* __Article 22 - Rights to social security__

   Affirms the social, economic and cultural rights as indispensable for the free development of everyones personality.
 
* __Article 26 - Right to education__

   Specifically addresses the right to education and promotes understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups.
 
* __Article 27 - Right to take part in cultural, artistic and scientific life__

   Promotes a more inclusive society where diverse cultural expressions are valued and protected
 
* __Article 29 - Duty to your community__

   Emphasizes the importance of inclusive communities for personal development.

### 3.3 Int. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) & Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) 1966

On the 16th December 1966, the UN General Assembly adopted two international treaties that would elaborate on and transform the aspirational rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into binding commitments. The [International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-economic-social-and-cultural-rights) and the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights).

The ICESCR rights relevant to Diversity and Inclusion.
---

* Article 10 - Protection of family and minors
* Article 13 - The right to education

  _"Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity, and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. They further agree that education shall enable all persons to participate effectively in a free society, promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations and all racial, ethnic or religious groups, and further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace."_

The ICCPR rights relevant to Diversity & Inclusion.

### 3.4 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 1989

Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)
23 years after the adoption of the International Bill of Human Rights (ICCPR and ICESCR) and in response to the growing need for recognition of children as individuals with specific vulnerabilities, the [Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-child) was adopted in 1989.

The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) aims to protect the rights of children worldwide. The CRC defines a child as any human being under the age of 18, and calls on States Parties to take all appropriate measures to ensure that children’s rights are protected. These include the right to a name and nationality; freedom of speech and thought; access to healthcare and education; and freedom from exploitation, torture, and abuse.

### 3.5 The Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education 1994 

With over 300 participants from 92 countries and 25 international organisations, the 1994 World Conference "Education for Special Needs: Access and Quality" was held in Salamanca, Spain. With the aim of promoting "Education for All", necessary policy changes were made to promote inclusive education to help schools cater for all children, especially those with special needs.

The adopted ["Salamanca Statement and Framework for Action on Special Needs Education"](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000098427) sets out the principles, policies and practices of special needs education and establishes a framework for action. 

The document __emphasises inclusion__ and the need for a "school for all" that values differences, promotes learning and takes individual needs into account.

The core beliefs
---

* _every child has a fundamental right to education, and must be given the opportunity to achieve and maintain an acceptable level of learning,_
* _every child has unique characteristics,interests,abilities and learning needs,_
* _education systems should be designed and educational programmes implemented to take into account the wide diversity of these characteristics and needs,_
* _those with special educational needs must have access to regular schools which should accommodate them within a childcentred pedagogy capable of meeting these needs,_

_Regular schools with this inclusive orientation are the most effective means of combating discriminatory attitudes, creating welcoming communities, building an inclusive society and achieving education for all; moreover, they provide an effective education to the majority of children and improve the efficiency and ultimately the cost-effectiveness of the entire education system._

Relevant guidelines for inclusive action on national level
---

19. _"The practice of ‘mainstreaming’ children with disabilities should be an integral part of national plans for achieving education for all. Even in those exceptional cases where children are placed in special schools, their education need not be entirely segregated. Part-time attendance at regular schools should be encouraged. Necessary provision should also be made for ensuring inclusion of youth and adults with special needs in secondarya nd higher educationa s well as in training programmes. Special attention should be given to ensuring equality of access and opportunity for girls and women with disabilities."_

26. _Developing inclusive schools that cater for a wide range of pupils in both urban and rural areas requires: the articulation of a clear and forceful policy on inclusion together with adequate financial provision - an effective public information effort to combat prejudice and create informed and positive attitudes - an extensive programme of orientation and staff training - and the provision of necessary support services. Changes in all the following aspects of schooling, as well as many others, are necessary to contribute to the success of inclusive schools: curriculum, buildings, school organization, pedagogy, assessment, staffing, school ethos and extracurricular activities._

53. _The success of the inclusive school depends considerably on early identification, assessment and stimulation of the very young child with special educational needs. Early childhood care and education programmes for children aged up to 6 years ought to be developed and/or reoriented to promote physical, intellectual and social development and school readiness. These programmes have a major economic value for the individual, the family and the society in preventing the aggravation of disabling conditions. Programmes at this level should recognize the principle of inclusion and be developed in a comprehensive way by combining pre-school activities and early childhood health care._

68. _Policy-makers at all levels, including the school level, should regularly reaffirm their commitment to inclusion and promote positive attitudes among children, among teachers and among the public-at-large towards those with special educational needs._

The Salamanca Declaration and Framework for Action reflect a global consensus on the future directions of special needs education.

### 3.6 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) 2006

Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
Following the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) 17 years ago, the [Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/convention-rights-persons-disabilities) was adopted on 13 December 2006. It marked a shift from viewing disability as a medical or welfare issue to a human rights issue. __The convention strongly emphasized inclusion and inclusive education__ as key principles for social participation.

The following rights of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are especially relevant to Diversity and Inclusion.
---

* __Article 3 - General principles__

  * Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons
  * Non-discrimination
  * Full and effective participation and inclusion in society
  * Respect for difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity Equality of opportunity
  * Accessibility
  * Equality between men and women
  * Respect for the evolving capacities of children with disabilities and respect for the right of children with disabilities to preserve their identities.

* __Article 5 - Equality and non-discrimination__
* __Article 8 - Awareness-raising__
* __Article 19 - Living independently and being included in the community__

  * States Parties to this Convention recognize the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live in the community, with choices equal to others, and shall take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoyment by persons with disabilities of this right and their full inclusion and participation in the community.

* __Article 21 - Freedom of expression and opinion, and access to information__
* __Article 24 - Education__

  * States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. With a view to realizing this right without discrimination and on the basis of equal opportunity, States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and life long learning.

* __Article 26 - Habilitation and rehabilitation__

  * States Parties shall take effective and appropriate measures, including through peer support, to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence, full physical, mental, social and vocational ability, and full inclusion and participation in all aspects of life.

* __Article 29 - Participation in political and public life__
* __Article 30 - Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport__

### 3.7 Sustainable Developement Goals 2030 (SDGs) 2015

The [Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) were established in 2015 during the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. They were created to address the global challenges facing humanity, including inequality, climate change, and peace and justice.

SDG 4 - Quality Education
---

__Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4__ on education calls for inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning
opportunities for all by 2030. It emphasizes inclusion and equity as laying foundations for quality education and learning.

SDG 4 also calls for building and upgrading education facilities that are child-, disability-, and gender-sensitive and for
providing safe, non-violent, inclusive and effective learning environments for all.

To achieve this ambitious __goal, countries should ensure inclusion and equity in and through education systems__ and programs.
This includes taking steps to prevent and address all forms of exclusion and marginalization, disparity, vulnerability and
inequality in educational access, participation, and completion as well as in learning processes and outcomes. It also requires
understanding learners’ diversities as opportunities in order to enhance and democratize learning for all students. See UNESCO (2017)[^1]

## 4. Inclusive Education and School Organization

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/school.png)

Despite the well-established legal right to inclusive education (presented in chapter 3), the debate on what constitutes inclusive education in schools remains more or less unresolved. 

We have international evidence according to the question of requirements that are essential for implementing inclusive education (e.g., Köpfer et al., 2021)[^1]. However, this is far from being the standard in all mainstream school systems: e.g., the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) still expressed concerns about the prevalence of special schools and classes in Germany and the barriers encountered by children with disabilities and their families to enrolling in mainstream schools (see CRPD, 2023)[^2]. 

Detailed information is available in the “[Education and Disability: Analysis of Data from 49 Countries” (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2018).[^3]

In the following, we look on the term of inclusive education in-depth. We then look at three different levels, emphasizing aspects of quality in inclusive education that are well established in the scientific literature on inclusive schooling and pedagogy.

> __Learning Goals__
> 
> * You are able to specify what _inclusive_ education means.
> * You are able to explain how inclusive education could be implemented in schools on different levels (i.e., educational system, single school, lesson).

### 4.1 Inclusive Education – a Broad Term with a Common Sense

It becomes clear that inclusion is a sense of belonging, feeling respected and valued and being seen for who we are as individuals. However, it takes a certain level of commitment and supportive energy from school leaders and colleagues, as well as other educators, for us as individuals and as a collective to be inclusive in the school system (see Miller & Katz, 2002)[^1].

> “Inclusive education is meaningful only when embedded in understandings about 
> community and communality, only when seen as both reflective of, and creative of
> inclusion in society”
>
> --Thomas (2013)[^2]. 

With this quote in mind, underpinning this OER is a broad understanding of inclusive education including changes and modifications in structures, approaches, strategies, teaching methods and content.

The intention is that social systems involved near (such as schools and families) or far (such as school principals, university teachers, politicians) in school education, overcome barriers and discrimination with a vision serving to provide all students with equitable and participatory education (cf. also Köpfer et al., 2021)[^3].

With the help of the previous chapters looking on social system theories (chapter 1) and main terms in flux (chapter 2), we have worked towards this broad understanding and intention.

In line with the understanding presented, the following figure shows nine characteristics of inclusion in the education system.

9 Characteristic of Inclusion in the Education System
------

<center>![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/concept-inclusion-650px.jpg "(Central Board of Secondary Education, 2020, p. 14)[^4]")</center>

Regarding to this common broad understanding, politicians of the educational system as well as school principals have a central role when it comes to the structures and values that promote inclusive education fully. 

In the next Chapter

In the following, we focus on the Response-to-intervention approach as a way of targeted prevention that is implemented in successful educational nations.

### 4.2 Response-To-Intervention Approach

Based on the question of how successful educational nations deal with pupils who do not reach the minimum standards in maths or language, _“Response to Intervention” (RTI) is a highly effective approach to supporting at-risk pupils and getting positive learning outcomes"_ (Hattie, 2018)[^1].

The __main objective of RTI__ is not to identify students for special education but rather to help all students achieve at a proficient level and ultimately make adequate yearly progress. That means, it is not about categorising children as “need special support” and “no need of special support”, but about knowing exactly who is “not yet able” or successful enough in achieving competences, but can achieve it with targeted support and encouragement. Therefore, ongoing diagnostics is necessary (Osberg, 2010)[^2].

The RTI approach is often visualised as a pyramid and a model of three levels or tiers (see illustration). 

* The lowest level __(tier 1)__, which benefits all learners, is regular teaching and responding adaptively to different learning requirements. However, there are limits. 
* Children whose diagnostics indicate competences that they have not yet achieved receive a focussed intervention as short-term, curriculum-based intensive small group and/or individual interventions at the next higher level __(tier 2)__, in order to catch up with the class. In many schools, this affects between 15 and 20 per cent of all pupils; depending on the context of the school, the proportion can be even higher. 
* The third stage __(tier 3)__ means “special intervention”, it is used for learners for whom the focussed intervention has not yet been sufficient. It is designed for the longer term, is individualised and is based on in-depth diagnostics. This often affects around five per cent of learners, for whom responsible and professional pedagogical action can be guaranteed through this form of intervention (see University od Rostock)[^3].
* Ongoing individual diagnostic in inclusive classes, individual support for both high-achieving and low-achieving students

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/rti-model.png "Pretti-Frontczak et al., 2014, p. 110[^4]")



Video explaining the RTI Model
-------
Let's view the following video to find out more details about the approach.

!?[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkK1bT8ls0M&t "Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkK1bT8ls0M")

<details>

<summary>Click here to show the video transcript</summary>

Here we'll look at a three- tiered model often depicted as a triangle as one example of how a tiered framework can be used as a schoolwide strategy. For instructing all students all students will participate in tier one instruction at this level they'll receive effective differentiated instruction provided by the general classroom teacher as part of an evidence-based Core Curriculum. 

The evidence-based instruction offered at this level can be expected to meet the learning needs of 80 to 85% of all students for students who don't respond adequately to Tier 1 instruction. More intensive interventions come into play tier 2 interventions build upon the differentiated instruction provided at tier one by offering students more systematic instruction and intervention strategically designed to help them catch up in areas of difficulty.

These interventions are usually delivered to a small group of students within the general classroom either by the classroom teacher or by another team member supporting the teacher who has also been trained to deliver the interventions tier 2 intervention will be offered to the 15% of students for whom Tier 1 instruction was not sufficiently intensive to meet their specific learning needs. 

But here is a critical point students who receive targeted tier 2 interventions continue to participate in general tier one instruction. Tier two interventions do not replace the Core Curriculum they supplement it for example Dennis has been selected to receive tier 2 interventions. 

Based on the results of recent reading fluency data he'll continue to participate in the 90 minutes of core reading instruction that is provided to all students in tier one each day but in addition he'll spend another 30 minutes per day receiving targeted reading instruction at tier 2. 

Under RTI his opportunities for learning and for catching up to his classmates will have been extended we've saved the most intensive interventions available for the small percentage of students who still lag significantly behind their peers in making academic gains. 

Tier three interventions supplement the previous tiers by providing the most intensive evidence-based interventions to delivered to individual students or in very small groups. 

Again the intensity of instruction at this level increases the size of student groups is reduced and their opportunities for direct instruction extended interventions. 

In tier three may be delivered by an intervention specialist or even a special education teacher but again these interventions supplement the instruction provided at tier one not replace it and students do not have to be identified as disabled in order to receive these interventions. 

Only about 5% of all students will require these intensive tier 3 interventions of these students only a portion may go on to require special ed services

</details>

.

When looking at this approach, it quickly becomes clear that educational policies and structures as well as competences of the school principals as mangers are crucial. RTI needs cooperation between educational actors (school principals, teachers, other professions, also parents) and in fact, this is a key prerequisite for quality education and professionalisation. 

In the next chapter
-----
In the following, we will look at different types of cooperation.

### 4.3 Cooperation und Multiprofessionalty

Types of Cooperation
------

Based on Lütje-Klose et al.(2024)[^1] a distinction can be made between:

1.	__Multiprofessional cooperation__ (i.e. between different professional groups, e.g. involving teachers, special needs teachers and school social workers in multi-perspective and case-related counselling, diagnostics and support planning),

2.	__Intraprofessional cooperation__ (i.e. within a professional group, e.g. between subject teachers) and

3.	__Interprofessional cooperation__ (i.e. between two professional groups, e.g. classroom teachers and special needs teachers, who work together in a class in relation to teaching).

All types of cooperation require a partnership relationship in which __goals, knowledge, resources, tasks and responsibilities__ are consciously shared. Such a relationship requires the development of trust and respect. Furthermore, team development requires time and commitment (Friend & Cook, 2010)[^2].



Multi-professional teams
-----

Looking on international research, it is undisputed that multiprofessional teams and successful cooperation between the different educational actors are particularly crucial for inclusive education and the individual support of a diverse student body (Köpfer et al., 2021)[^3]. 

The following illustration includes main features and conditions of successful multiprofessional teams.:

<center>![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/multiprof-teams-crop.png "Own illustration based on Widmer-Wolf (2018)[^4]")</center>

Establishing different kinds of cooperation, general schools can adopt changes in overall structure that inclusion becomes a part of the school’s culture. The role of school leaders is crucial; they are kind of managers in the schools but also responsible for social networking. 

Intraprofessional cooperation could be seen as a lower challenge because the actors have the same professional background, they have an idea of each other’s expertise and could change perspectives easier. Interprofessional cooperation is a main structure for inclusive lessons in general schools.


A model teachers` perspectives on co-teaching
----

Let’s have a look at what teachers need to be successful in inclusive classrooms. The following illustration is a model of teachers’ perspectives on the conditions for successful co-teaching by Jurkowski, S., Ulrich, M., & Müller, B. (2023)[^5]. The categories describe the conditions for successful co-teaching in inclusive classes on the levels of the educational system, the single school, and the teaching dyad.

<details>

<summary> __Level 1 - Educational System__ (click to view)</summary>

* We identiﬁed two categories that refer to the educational systems of the federal states in Germany: "teacher education" and "inclusive school system". The category "teacher education" included aspects of professionalisation in the ﬁeld of inclusive education (i.e. study curricula, pre-service and in-service teacher training). The special education teachers interviewed stated their lack of didactical knowledge that they would need for teaching large groups. In contrast, the general teachers reported the need for knowledge about their students’ special needs to provide suﬃcient assistance to those students when the special education teacher is not in the class. The category "Inclusive school system" reﬂected the teachers’ ideas about the implementation of inclusion and the educational opportunities for children with special needs. It became clear that the teachers have the wish for the development of a full-inclusive school system. However, some  were not convinced that the high-achiever would benefit.

* The three main categories on this level concern structural and organisational conditions as well as attitudes towards co-teaching and co-teachers’ collaboration in inclusive classes: "organisation of inclusive teaching" (time for teaching dyads, equipment, and teaching concepts), "multi-professional cooperation" (cooperation within a school, with external professionals, and with parents and families), and "principals’ administration" (principals’ responsibility to provide co-teachers with guidelines as well as their attitudes towards inclusive schooling).

* The level of the co-teacher contains six categories regarding to a social-emotional as well as role-related aspects: "relationship" (e.g., sympathy), "task assignment" (e.g., professional role-taking), "forms of collaboration" (e.g., shared reflecion on a lesson and constructive planning), individual "beneﬁts from co-teaching" (Entlastung, berufliches Lernen); "self-organisation" (Zeitfenster für Absprachen), and "inclusive learning arrangements" (je nach Klasse anpassen).

Overall, this chapter 5 has shown which adjustments the school system - whether at the political-educational system level, the school management level or the teaching level - is and must be capable of acting on in order to organise inclusive education. In view of the legal situation, it should not be a question of whether inclusion is possible in the school context; instead, all educational stakeholders must act cooperatively in their various roles, set out on a journey and pursue common goals. Ultimately, development takes time and positive experiences!

In the following chapter, we will move away from the professional level of action and look at the diversity characteristics of the pupils that teachers may be confronted with in their classes.

### 4.4 Co-Teaching

The most important aspects of establishing a co-teaching relationship are outlined below. 

The differentiation of six established forms takes place under the point of the distribution of roles and responsibilities. 

Finally, we look at a video in which teachers share their experiences.

1. Getting to know each other (similarities and differences)
---

An important first step in the development of co-teaching is for the co-teaching partners to get to know each other. Spending hours together every day and sharing all aspects of teaching can be fun, but it can also lead to frustration and conflict. 

* The first step is to discuss goals, interests, teaching and working styles and preferences for giving and receiving feedback.

2. Sharing roles and responsibilities
----

The aim is to plan, implement and evaluate the lesson together and to share responsibilities. Different strengths of the co-teachers can come into play in the planning and design of lessons, but both should play an equal part in all aspects of the lesson. In well-functioning co-teaching classes, it is often impossible to tell at first glance who is a special needs teacher and who is a mainstream teacher because both are equally committed and have an equal say.

_Six forms of Co-Teaching_
----

In practice dividing up roles and responsibilities between two teachers can be achieved in either one of the following six forms or a mixture of them.

Regardless of which model of collaboration co-teachers implement, they are required to engage in an intensive examination of how both experts want to share their responsibility for planning, implementing and evaluating lessons. If both experts give each other appropriate freedom of action in these aspects, their competencies are not only used, but also expanded over time and can therefore be used more flexibly

3. Develop a shared classroom in detail
----

Once co-teachers have laid the foundations for good collaboration and agreed on how to share their roles, it is important to think about the detailed issues of their collaboration. 

<center>![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/co-teaching-factors.png "Crucial factors for Co-teaching, own illustration")</center>

This includes understanding how to design and use the shared classroom and how to deal with class rules and consequences. 

Questions that should be discussed in this context are (click the title to expand)
---


<details>

<summary> __How do we introduce ourselves to pupils and parents as two class teachers?__</summary>

* From the first day of school letter, information evening, etc.

* Names of both teachers on the classroom door and on documents 

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary>__How do we have equal access to resources such as desks, cupboards, teaching materials, technical infrastructure and equipment, workbooks, the blackboard?__</summary>

* Discussions about room/material design and allocation may seem minor at first, but they are crucial to ensure that both teachers have equal access. There are teachers who are very reluctant to share their materials - open communication is therefore important.

* It is helpful to work with the school management to ensure that there are enough materials and furniture in the classroom for both teachers.

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary> __How will we share responsibility for writing individual support plans, letters/emails home, communications in the form of phone calls and meetings with parents, development of project and lesson plans, assessment of tests and project tasks, materials and seating plans?__</summary>

* It is important to share communication with families. This includes deliberately not dividing students into "my" and "your" students, but seeing all students and their families as "ours". Co-teachers must therefore agree how and with what frequency they frequency they wish to contact parents, who will inform parents about various events/appointments and how they will share messages from parents.

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary> __How do we share information about individual students, changes to lesson plans and teaching materials that need to be developed together?__</summary>

* It is important that co-teachers choose an effective communication system to share information, discuss upcoming deadlines, and plan lessons. 

* While some co-teachers meet immediately after class, other co-teachers prefer to email or call each other later. It is also helpful if co-teachers agree on a place where they both have access to messages from parents and collected materials.

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary> __How do we share responsibility for the assessment of tests, project performance, progress in development plans, student behavior?__</summary>

* Co-teachers need to agree what type of assessment of student performance they will use and at what time frame and interval. It is essential that both teachers have an equal say in the assessment of student work, project contributions and tests. 

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary> __How do we share responsibility for class rules and rituals regarding our class, small groups and individual students?__</summary>

* Co-teachers need to agree on class rules and rituals in advance, for example, rituals at the beginning and end of the day, when students want to use the bathroom or change classrooms; their tolerance limits when dealing with noise or rule violations; and agreements on deadlines regarding the communication and submission of homework.

</details>

<br>

On the one hand, it is crucial that co-teachers take enough time to discuss and answer these questions and, on the other hand, that any disagreements that do arise are not resolved in front of the students, but in private.

Only when co-teachers have taken the time to lay the foundations for co-teaching does it make sense for them to face up to the actual planning and implementation of joint lessons.

#### Deutsch


Im Folgenden werden die wichtigsten Aspekte zum Aufbau einer Co-Teaching Beziehung herausgearbeitet. Die Differenzierung von sechs etablierten Formen erfolgt unter dem Punkt der Verteilung von Rollen und Verantwortlichkeiten. Abschließend betrachten wir ein Video, in dem Lehrpersonen ihre Erfahrungen teilen.

1. Kennenlernen (von Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschieden)

Ein wichtiger erster Schritt bei der Entwicklung des Co-Teaching ist das gegenseitige Sich-Kennenlernen der Co-Teaching-Partner. Täglich Stunden miteinander zu verbringen und alle Aspekte des Unterrichtens miteinander zu teilen, kann Spaß machen, aber auch zu Frustration und Konflikten führen. Zu Beginn gilt es, sich über Ziele, Interessen, Unterrichts- und Arbeitsstile und Präferenzen für das Geben und Empfangen von Feedback auszutauschen.

2. Rollen und Verantwortlichkeiten teilen

Ziel ist es, die Planung, Umsetzung und Auswertung des Unterrichts gemeinsam durchzuführen und Verantwortlichkeiten zu teilen. Verschiedene Stärken der Co-Teacher können in der Planung und Gestaltung des Unterrichts zum Tragen kommen, dennoch sollen beide gleichermaßen einen Part in allen Aspekten des Unterrichts spielen. Oftmals ist in gut funktionierenden Co-Teaching-Klassen auf den ersten Blick nicht feststellbar, wer Sonder- und wer Regelschulpädagoge ist, weil beide gleich engagiert sind und gleiches Mitspracherecht haben.
Es gibt verschiedenste Modelle, Rollen und Verantwortlichkeiten der Co-Teacher aufzuteilen. 
HIER KÄMEN DIE 6 FORMEN wie Michael bereits gemacht hat
Unabhängig davon, welches Modell der Zusammenarbeit Co-Teacher umsetzen, sind sie gefordert, sich auf eine intensive Auseinandersetzung mit der Frage einzulassen, wie beide Expert*innen ihre Verantwortung des Planens, Umsetzens und Auswertens des Unterrichts teilen wollen. Geben beide Expert*innen einander entsprechende Handlungsfreiheit in diesen Aspekten, werden ihre Kompetenzen nicht nur genutzt, sondern mit der Zeit erweitert und infolge stärker variierbar einsetzbar

3. Ein geteiltes Klassenzimmer im Detail entwickeln

Nachdem Co-Teacher das Fundament für eine gute Zusammenarbeit gelegt und sich über das Teilen ihrer Rollen verständigt haben, ist es wichtig, über detaillierte Fragen ihrer Zusammenarbeit nachzudenken. Hierzu gehört die Verständigung über das Gestalten und Nutzen des gemeinsamen Klassenzimmers sowie den Umgang mit Klassenregeln und Konsequenzen. Fragen, die in diesem Zusammenhang diskutiert werden sollten sind:

* Wie stellen wir uns Schülern und Eltern als zwei Klassenlehrer*innen vor?
  
  * vom ersten Schultag an Brief, Informationsabend, etc.
  * Namen beider Lehrer*innen auf der Klassenzimmertür und auf Dokumenten 

* Wie haben wir gleichberechtigten Zugang zu Ressourcen wie z.B. Schreibtischen, Schränken, Unterrichtsmaterial, technische Infrastruktur und Zubehör, Arbeitsbüchern, der Tafel?
  
  * Auseinandersetzungen zur Raum-/Materialgestaltung und -aufteilung scheinen zunächst nebensächlich, sind jedoch von entscheidender Bedeutung, damit beide Lehrer*innen gleichberechtigten Zugang haben. Es gibt Lehrer*innen, die nur sehr ungern ihr Material teilen – offene Kommunikation ist daher wichtig.
  * Hilfreich ist hier, mit der Schulleitung zusammenzuarbeiten, um sicherzustellen, dass genügend Materialen und Möbel in der Klasse für beide Lehrer*innen vorhanden sind.

* Wie werden wir die Verantwortung für das Schreiben von individuellen Förderplänen, Briefen/E-Mails nach Hause, Mitteilungen in Form von Telefonaten und Treffen mit Eltern, Entwicklung von Projekt- und Unterrichtsplänen, Bewertung von Tests und Projektaufgaben, Materialien und Sitzplänen teilen?
  
  * Es ist von Belang, die Kommunikation mit Familien gemeinsam zu gestalten. Dazu gehört, dass Schüler*innen bewusst nicht in „meine“ und „deine“ Schüler*innen unterteilt werden, sondern dass alle Schüler*innen und ihre Familien als „unsere“ angesehen werden. Co-Teacher müssen demzufolge vereinbaren, wie und mit welcher Häufigkeit sie mit Eltern in Kontakt treten möchten, wer Eltern über verschiedenste Ereignisse/Termine informiert und wie sie die Mitteilungen von Eltern miteinander teilen.
  * Wie teilen wir Informationen über einzelne Schüler*innen, Änderungen von Unterrichtsplänen und Unterrichtsmaterialien, die gemeinsam entwickelt werden müssen, miteinander?

* Es ist wichtig, dass Co-Teacher sich für ein effektives Kommunikationssystem entscheiden, um Informationen auszutauschen, anstehende Termine zu diskutieren, und Unterricht zu planen. Während manche Co-Teacher sich dazu jeweils direkt nach dem Unterricht treffen, bevorzugen es andere Co-Teacher, sich später eine E-Mail zu schreiben oder anzurufen. Es ist zudem hilfreich, wenn Co-Teacher einen Ort vereinbaren, an dem beide Zugang zu Nachrichten von Eltern und gesammelte Materialien haben.

* Wie teilen wir die Verantwortung für die Bewertung von Tests, Projektleistungen, Fortschritten in Entwicklungsplänen, Verhalten der Schüler*innen?
  
   * Co-Teacher müssen vereinbaren, welche Art der Bewertung von Schüler*innenleistungen sie anwenden wollen und in welchem Zeitrahmen und –abstand. Es ist maßgeblich, dass beide Lehrer*innen bei der Bewertung von Schüler*innenarbeiten, Projektbeiträgen und Tests gleiches Mitspracherecht haben. 

* Wie teilen wir die Verantwortung für Klassenregeln und –rituale hinsichtlich unserer Klasse, Kleingruppen und einzelner Schüler*innen?
  
  * Co-Teacher müssen sich im Vorfeld auf Klassenregeln und –rituale einigen, zum Beispiel auf Rituale am Anfang und Ende des Tages, wenn Schüler*innen das Badezimmer benutzen wollen oder Klassenräume wechseln; auf ihre Toleranzgrenzen beim Umgang mit Lärm, bzw. Regelverstößen sowie auf terminliche Vereinbarungen in Bezug auf Mitteilung und Abgabe von Hausaufgaben.

Entscheidend ist zum einen, dass Co-Teacher sich genügend Zeit zum Besprechen und Beantworten dieser Fragen nehmen, und zum anderen, dass dennoch auftretende Meinungsverschiedenheiten nicht vor den Schüler*innen, sondern unter vier Augen geklärt werden.

Erst wenn Co-Teacher sich die Zeit genommen haben, die Grundlage für Co-Teaching zu legen, macht es Sinn, dass sie sich dem tatsächlichen Planen und Durchführen des gemeinsamen Unterrichts stellen.

Special Education and Regular Education: Working Together
---

<details>

<summary>Click here to show the video transcript</summary>

Co-teaching, at least at Hawthorne and I think elsewhere, is when we have all of our specialists come in
and we keep all of our kids inside the classroom. And we get the opportunity to work as a team within the classroom so that all the kids are staying inside our classroom. So we have LIA teachers that come into our rooms. We also have ELL teachers, and then we also have our SPED teachers that all come into our classroom during their times and work with our students. I find it very beneficial, having all of the specialists come into my classroom. One of the biggest benefits I find, is that we are all on the same page. And so at any point, during our collaboration, they come to our collaborations. They also look at, we write up a sheet every week that we share on the Google Docs and they're able to read through it and look at what we're teaching if they're not able to come to collaboration. But they try to come and then when we come into the room, we're able to work together, to hopefully help these students find success. And what we do and what I love is its, for me decreased a lot of the behaviors. Because those transitions are sometimes the hardest part for students. And when you take away those transitions, you have the opportunity for learning to increase and for the behaviors and the management to decrease. And so it's been really helpful because then we have more eyes onthe whole group.

* __Tanya:__ With pushing,we have anywhere between five to seven students in the classroom and they're all served under a reading or writing disability on an IEP. And I work with the teacher to help make sure their accommodations are in place, to help them out in the classroom and to also kind of troubleshoot, any issues the teacher may run into. And I'm just right there for them to talk to or to email quickly. And then I also work with emailing all of the case managers of those students, to let them know what they did that day, what they maybe missed if they got it done If they didn't. To kind of help those students stay caught upin those regular English classes. In there I don't treat them any differently and I help out all the students that are in there. Because I wanna make sure, that our students are not singled out. Because they already know they have a disability and they don't necessarily like if people know it as well. So that's kinda my goal is to help everybody out when they're, working on something to help all students out. And the teachers see that as well. They tell all the other teachers as well. Mrs. Bjerke is in here to help everybody. You can ask her, you can ask me if you have questions.

* __Aj__: Two teachers working together to meet the needs of students that struggle in math. It takes two adults so they can reach more students. And then were sharing the load of the teaching and great level material. The core math teacher kinda holds the, kinda more of the knowledge of that subject. So she teaches more of it. But as the class goes, I pop in ask questions, kinda think in terms and then go around and helping my students. And we both work together to adapt it or come up with ways to reach our students easier. It helps more students be able to get great level material presented at their level. So then we only have to do as many pull-outs where kinda the research classes. I mean they widen the gap for the learning where this allows them to be in getting great level materials presented at their level. The alternative to this yeah there's is pull out, which I also teach to those classes. The only alternative if we didn't have co-teaching, would be that we would have to pull out and try to modify the the curriculum at their level where this is more presented at theirs. They want their peers they don't feel like they're excluded.

* __Christi__: I have a better understanding of the materials just 'cause I've been doing this for four years. I actually started at Whittier as a co-teacher in the special ed department, and fell in love with the curriculum so I moved to math. And so I think it's good that I have the special ed background and it helps me in the co-taught classroom. But together we plan, we talk about things that we wanna do. We have bright ideas that don't always come to fruition. As a classroom teacher, I have to have knowledge of the special ed students. What their accommodations are and what I need to do. But it's always nice to have that second person in the classroom to come up with different strategies or maybe they suggest trying it a different way. Or when he questions the students, asking them a question in a different way than what I would've thought about asking it. Bouncing ideas off of them using them together, which is something that I don't know if it'll work talking it through with him. Sometimes he thinks I'm crazy, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. So it's nice to have that second third person 'cause there's a lot of movement in the morning with different math teachers and talking about what we're doing that day and why we're doing it and how we're doing it. And so it's nice to have somebody who knows our students and to bounce ideas off of them.

* __LeeAnna__: Another benefit that I have found, that we've done is flexible grouping. So that flexible grouping allows us to take kids that yes, they might be on an IEP, they might not be on an IEP, but they might need that additional support and we can put them together. And so there's some days that, I might have one of my specialists come in and they might not be working with a specific child that they're supposed to be working with. Based on the fact that, we know how many hours each of our students need for the required amount. And we can work together to fulfill those hours. So it's been pretty cool because then we have that opportunity together to work with the kids. And so if I'm not able to get a kiddo to be able to, if they're struggling with their reading and I'm not able to do something to help motivate them, one of my coworkers might be able to do that.  And one of my specialists and vice versa sometimes we'll look at each other and then say you know, Oh, we're really struggling here. I'm not sure what we need to do next. I can just go right over there and say, let's try this and they can do the same for me. So it's been really helpful for us to be able to build that comradery. And then those kids, don't even know that there's any difference between one from the other. And so they just, it's another day. All the people come in, all the people go out and they know that more than likely they're gonna be working in one of those groups. Mostly for our kiddos who come in, who are on an IEP, they have that label. That label can be very scary to parents. The older they get, the kids realize they have a label. But when, we have the co-teaching occurring, I don't even know if, the majority of my kids who are, are qualifying for SPED even knowing that they are. And that's the powerful piece for me because it's rebuilt relationships, confidence. It's shown them that they are a part of us, they're not any different. And I've been here for 12 years. And so seeing that growth over time and how we've changed and it's been a positive switch for me. It had to require some growth mindset on my part as well knowing that there's gonna be people in here as I'm teaching, I better be organized, I better have myself ready to go. And they might be a little louder than I typically would expect at a certain time. But the loudness is not them being off task, rather It's more on task. So that's been helpful for me too because then I can say, yes I hear them, but at the same time they're on task. They're doing what they need to be doing. They're answering questions, they're recalling whatever we're doing whether it's reading or writing or math. And so that's been really fun for us to see as well.  We have seen an increase in students passing rates in these classes where they struggled before. Because regular education teachers have, almost 100 students probably in a day that they see. And our students are a very small percentage of that. And so by, being able to have a teacher in there, who's monitoring those students, we can catch them and keep them caught up before they fall so far behind, that it's just impossible to get them caught up. It also gives them some confidence and also helps give them some skills. Like for me as the Freshmen English teacher, to kind of get those freshmen on the right path for the rest of high school in order to make sure they start off on a good foot. Some students have to be pulled to be read to. And so, they kind of I will talk to them privately like, Hey, we have a test coming up. After your teacher gives you your test, come with me, just leave the room like to make no big deal of it. They also, kind of know I'm the one to go to if they're stuck with something and they're not really sure. So that piece is nice as well as having that additional person who knows what they're doing and that works in study hall too. Like all of our students have the same study hall times roughly between fourth and fifth period and so, if their teacher has no idea what they did they can send them to us or to me, and then I can help them out. Or the teacher will come ask me what they're doing but, students, they kind of they know that I know but then they don't have to say anything about it either. Like they're struggling so I can kind of help them advocate for their needs too.

* __Aj__: They're with their peers, they're not being pulled out.They're not, again, back in the day where they're always excluded. And so getting the label of learning disability you're excluded from all your peers. While here they just feel like they're with everyone else. Most of the people in here, I would say half the students in here don't even know I'm a special ed teacher. They just think I'm another teacher in the room. That's the other perk is they're learning from the students that math is easier for them. So then the different mindset, the problem solving kinda hearing from them instead of just hearing from the same group of kids that are all just struggling in math. They do learn strategies from their peers. 'Cause the special ed kids bring a different mindset also. So they might not, math might not come easy, but they come up with a different way of thinking of stuff. So it also makes the ones who really get it easy to kinda slow down and rethink and then they can also teach. So, the best way that we know as teachers if a student can teach it, they really have a material down. So we do allow our students that excel to kinda step back sometimes and help the other students and kind of a win-win for both.

* __Christi__: With the collaboration it is nice for the lower level students to be able to speak to somebody middle ranger or higher, and bounce ideas off. But I also think that the higher level thinkers they benefit from the lower students just because, they bring in a different idea. So I think they feel more comfortable with each other and they're able to talk to each other. At the school I was at, I had to push in and it was my first year of teaching. I didn't know the math curriculum very well. And I was hoping that they would help out more and kind of lead me a little bit or share some of their knowledge. And I think from that experience it led me to, wanna co-teach and be part of it just because two brains are better than one.

* __Tanya__: For the regular ed students, some of them need that additional support. And sometimes I can pick out the regular students that they might wanna consider some additional supports for additional services as well. And they can ask for, they can ask me for my input too the regular teachers can as well. I like seeing how different teachers teach. Like that's what a benefit I've gotten out of Whittier. Oh that's really cool, I wanna try that because we don't get to go out and see other teachers, how they teach and just sit and watch them sometimes. And it's just, it's built some good relationships between the departments that we've worked with, with this. Because they, sometimes have a different perspective on special ed. And then once you're able to kinda see how we work and see what it looks like, it kind of helps them understand, how that department works and how we are there to help them as teachers and help their students settle in their classroom as well.

* __Aj__: As a special ed teacher, you're coming in and not knowing the material as well as a co-teacher 'cause they've taught it for years or that's all they have. It's depending on how comfortable I am with the material, I jump in more, I teach or most of the time I kinda sit back and kinda think about questions that I can ask to kinda help in particular my students are not even if they're special or just kind of struggling students what kind of questions should they be asking, that they probably don't feel comfortable asking themselves. And I'll raise my hand and ask those questions. They're kind of my main role, and going around and kinda observing what they're doing with their work and kinda seeing if they need help and trying to be in their voice.

* __LeeAnna__: I think the advice that I can give, when it comes to co-teaching is just to have that growth mindset and to give it a try. It's scary and a little overwhelming at first. There's still a little hesitation with some here but we've come a long way in the time that I've been here. But once you get there, you don't wanna ever lose it. And so even when we have all of our supports with our reading teachers coming in and our ELL and our SPED it's just nice because anytime we see each other in the hall, we're able to say, "hey, this is what I worked on, this is what I saw with the gains". And we've seen student achievement rise with all of these kids in growth. And our main focus is always growth. And to be able to have that language and that conversation with a variety of teachers, and we're all seeing the same thing. it's been really powerful for us when we see our scores slowly rising. And it's not all about test scores but it is nice to have that visual to say, this is working. So that when we're going this is a little extra work, we have to make sure we're making time with other people. But at the same time we have that benefit of knowing all the great things that are coming out of it. And these students are feeling like they belong and they love being in their natural setting, their classroom. And for them to know they're not gonna leave and they don't have to leave. And they see a variety of students rotating between the groups. They don't know any different. They think that's just a part of how teaching works. And so it's been really cool to see that it happened here.

## 5. Students Diversity in Inclusive Classrooms

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/children-diversity.png)

In chapter 2, we defined the fact of diversity including the variety and difference of individuals in a society on three levels: social, biological, psychological. 

According to this theoretical frame and interdisciplinary empirical research, we take a closer look at _three dimensions of diversity and special characteristics of students_: 

5.1 social and ethnic origin, 

5.2 physical and cognitive abilities, 

5.3 personality and gender. 

Each chapter ends with a case-vignette. 

Moreover, in chapter 5.4., we put together a guideline “Reducing Bias in Communication” that helps you as an educator being a sensitive teacher, colleague, and partner in cooperation. 

Let’s start with the last main chapter and focusing on the individual level of students. With regard to the diversity discourse, we deliberately refrain from making a rough distinction between general students and students with special education needs or at-risk-students wherever possible!

> __Learning goals:__
>
> * You are able to describe the characteristics of student diversity in different dimensions.
> * You are able to judge situations of discrimination in school/lessons, analyse the situation from the students’ point of view and indicate a course of action appropriate to the situation and to justify this.


###	5.1 Social and Ethnic Origin

Similar to the social level of diversity, sociologists focus on features of social origin examining causes, mechanism, and consequences of discrimination (see chapter 2.3) and social inequality. 

Inequality is social insofar as it arises through social processes. However, the challenge again lies in a value-free definition; e.g. the definition: "Social inequality exists when people have different levels of well-being" (Brüderl, 2019)[^1]. Here, defining well-being also is difficult. Because of that the following definition is preferred:

> __Definition: Social inequality__
>
> Social inequality exists when people have different levels of primary and/or secondary intermediate goods. (Intermediate
> goods are the dimensions of social inequality such as education and financial capital.” (translated from Brüderl, 2019)[^1]

Whether inequality is just or unjust is another question, which we will not discuss here. 

For a common definition of social justice and a further description according to concepts, theory, and praxis see Abbott (2014)).[^2]

> __Definition: Social justice__
>
> Social justice is commonly viewed as a guiding principle to achieve a just society, understood both as a means as well as
> an end. It includes a wide variety of goals, including full and equal participation of individuals in all institutions; 
> fair, equitable distribution of material and nonmaterial goods; and recognition and support for the needs and rights of
> individuals. (cf. Abbott, 2014; see also Bell, 2007)[^2][^3]

In general, sociological researchers differ in terms of ascriptive features such as origin, sex/gender, ethnicity, blood group, hair colour, age, etc. and acquired features such as occupation, education, income and wealth. It is assumed that ascriptive features do not influence human wellbeing directly, but indirectly via primary and secondary intermediate goods.

In the next chapter, you can see some interrelation between well-being and exemplary, primary and secondary primal goods.

#### 5.1.1 Social and Socioeconomical Inequality

In principle, it is assumed that more or better intermediate goods increase individual wellbeing (see illustration according to Brüderl, 2019)[^1].

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/well-being-crop.png "Own illustration based on Brüderl, J. (2019)[^1]")

This illustration does not claim to be complete. Where do you see migration/ethnicity and sex/gender? Again and again, international comparative research showed that these aspects are crucial with regard to social and educational inequalities in current societies (OECD, 2024)[^2].

##### Deutsch

Aus soziologischer Sicht unterscheiden sich Menschen in Bezug auf zugeschriebene/askriptive Merkmale wie Herkunft, Geschlecht, Ethnizität, Blutgruppe, Haarfarbe, Alter etc. und erworbene Merkmale wie zum Beispiel Beruf, Bildung, Einkommen und Vermögen. Es wird angenommen, dass askriptive Merkmale das menschliche Wohlbefinden nicht direkt, sondern allenfalls indirekt über primäre und sekundäre Zwischengüter beeinflussen. Grundsätzlich wird angenommen, dass mehr/bessere Zwischengüter das individuelle Wohlbefinden erhöhen (see illustration below; translated from Brüderl, 2018).

![](88a9d34884378b02d42a321de1cb7f33e4cd5c73.jpg)

https://www.ls3.soziologie.uni-muenchen.de/studium-lehre/veranstaltungen/ws-2019-20/sozialstrukturanalyse_ws-19-20/tutorium-2_soz-strukt_ws19-20.pdf S.83

Einige askriptive Merkmale wie Herkunft (sozial/regional), Alter, Geschlecht und Ethnizität sind Korrelate sozialer Ungleichheit. Sie sind mit einem Mehr oder Weniger an (primären und sekundären) Zwischengütern verbunden, die letztlich das individuelle Wohlbefinden beeinflussen können. 

Definitionen zu sozialer Ungleichheit (Brüderl, 2018)
---

* Definition I: Soziale Ungleichheit liegt vor, wenn Menschen unterschiedliches Wohlbefinden haben.
* Definition II: Soziale Ungleichheit liegt vor, wenn Menschen über ein unterschiedliches Ausmaß an primären/sekundären Zwischengütern verfügen – Zwischengüter sind die „Dimensionen sozialer Ungleichheit“
Die Ungleichheit ist „sozial“, insofern sie durch soziale Prozesse entsteht. Ob Ungleichheit „gerecht“ oder „ungerecht“ ist, ist eine andere Frage, die wir an dieser Stelle nicht diskutieren. Es ist für diversitätssensible, inklusionsorientierte Lehrpersonen jedoch unerlässlich, dass sie über das Wohlbefinden ihrer Schüler und deren Familie Bescheid wissen. Soziale Ungleichheit zu reflektieren, Diskriminierung aktiv, proaktiv und reaktiv Diskriminierung zu vermeiden, ist Aufgabe der inklusiven Pädagogik.

Hier könnten wir die Grafik erweitert denken in Bezug auf Migration (education) und Geschlecht (gender gap) und dann Literaturangaben zu educational inequality and gender gab zum eigenen Weiterlesen empirischer befunde anbieten.

In the following
----
….. two case-vignettes…

#### 5.1.2 Ethic and Migration

Ethnic origin, which is systematically linked to various dimensions of inequality, can be operationalised in very different ways (e.g., via the place of birth in the country of origin or in the destination country). This operationalisation is particularly central in traditional immigration countries such as the USA or Canada.

Which groups are affected by ethnic inequality? 
---

In many late immigration countries, however, the children of immigrants are also categorised separately. This is particularly true in Germany, where an ethnically defined concept of nation prevailed for a long time and statistics differentiate according to the so-called “migration background” as a personal attribute. Because of the correspondence between the everyday understanding of belonging and the statistical definition, it is precisely that the concept of migration background is controversial, although it certainly represents progress compared to the differentiation between originals and foreigners (Diehl, 2024)[^1].

It is undisputable that sensitive and inclusion-oriented teachers need to be aware of the well-being of their students and families. Reflecting on social and ethnical inequality, actively, proactively and reactively avoiding discrimination is the task of inclusive pedagogy.

In the next chapter
----

In the following, we present the first of three case-vignettes, written, explored, and reflected by German Master students in a teacher education project seminar.

Please, take your time and keep in your mind: This is an exercise to think about your role-taking as a teacher in diverse classroom settings; it is not a test for choosing right or wrong answers!

<center>![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/1-tina.jpg "AI Image Gen generated image based on own prompt[^1]")</center>

> __"Social origin" case description__
> 
> Tina, 14 years old, is a local student in her 8th grade at the city high school who lives with her parents and three younger 
> brothers in the suburbs in the countryside. Since her mother has fallen seriously ill and her father has to look after the cheese 
> dairy and the inn on his own, the family's finances have become increasingly difficult. Tina therefore helps out in the service 
> area of the restaurant after school and only does her homework late in the evening. She can barely keep her eyes open in class 
> and during the breaks she sits away from her friends to rest.
> 
> As a teacher, you have no idea how much of a burden Tina is. She was always rather quiet in class and her performance was in the 
> middle range. However, when it comes to the class trip, she doesn't seem to be looking forward to it at all. You are worried - 
> and rightly so, because Tina then comes to you with the news that she doesn't want to go on the picnic next week or on the school 
> trip. She had a fight with her best friend - an answer that makes you think. The two friends sit next to each other in class.

Here, you can see some possible reactions. 
---

Please, think about your preferred action as the teacher. Also, reflect why you would do this as a first reaction? You can also note other ideas on a separate note (sharing with us on the [feedback wall](https://padlet.com/teacheredueuniwell/oerdiversityinclusion) in the section "content" after finishing this OER).

- Seek contact with the parents
- Accept Tina's decision without asking further questions
- Motivate Tina to participate
- Ask Tina and her friend to talk
- Seek dialogue within the teaching staff
- other ideas?

Here we will add visaulisations for the above points.

###	5.2 The Dimension of Physical and Cognitive Abilities

It is natural-given that we as human differ in individual physical and cognitive abilities. However, some individuals are disadvantaged in everyday life deviating from the norm in special physical and/or cognitive functions and structures. Here, norm refers to a medically diagnosed condition; i.e., health versus disease/disability). 

The [International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF)](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health), developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a code book that explains health and related conditions in an internationally standardised language. This enables worldwide communication about health and health care. 

The components are described from the perspective of the body, the individual and society in two main lists: 

1. Body functions and body structures 
2. Activities and participation 

accordingly, disability serves as a generic term for impairments of activity and participation. 

The ICF also lists environmental factors that interact with the aforementioned constructs. This enables the user to create useful profiles of a person's functioning, disability and health for different domains. Further, the ICF systematically groups different domains for a person with a specific health problem (e.g., what a person affected by disease actually can do).

</center>

Remembering chapters __xy and xy__, it is clear that teacher’s awareness and sensitive according to the individual (dis)abilities and wellbeing on students is crucial. However, a general education teacher in mainstream schools is not an expert in medicine and special education diagnostic. Therefore, multiprofessional cooperation and interprofessional co-teaching are needed as well as an open, inclusive attitude and general knowledge about some diseases and disabilities. 

Last but not least, it is crucial to know, that next to the [international version of the ICD-10 manual](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health) we can find relevant information according to a special disease/disability in the [national adaptations of the ICD-10 manual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10).

In the following chapter
---
Below, we selected three diseases and take a closer look on their codes in ICD-10; i.e., Autism, AD(H)S, Trisomy 21, and Adiposities:

#### 5.2.1 Autism-Spectrum-Disorders

According to the ICD-10, autism is categorised as a medical diagnosis of “pervasive developmental disorders” (code F.84). 

Due to the variety and diversity of autistic symptoms, the technical term autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is used; the term “spectrum” shows the endeavour to do justice to the wide range of symptoms and typical characteristics as well as the different strengths and abilities, but also the impairments that the respective people with ASD can exhibit.

In clinical diagnosis, a distinction is currently made between three main forms of ASD, which differ in particular with regard to: __Early childhood autism, asperger, atypical autism__. 

<center>
![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/autism-spectrum.png "Autism spectrum, own illustration")
</center>

The disorders summarised in this section have the following features in common (see ICD-10, 2024a):

* onset invariably in infancy or childhood,
* a developmental restriction or delay of functions that are closely linked to the biological maturation of the central nervous system,
* a steady course without remissions or relapses. 

##### Deutsch

Definition und Beschreibung: In den Diagnosekriterien der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO), der "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems“ ICD-10 wird Autismus (unter F.84) als medizinische Diagnose den „tiefgreifenden Entwicklungsstörungen“ zugeordnet. Wegen der Vielfalt und Unterschiedlichkeit autistischer Symptome wird mittlerweile der Fachbegriff Autismus-Spektrum-Störungen (ASS) verwendet. Die Bezeichnung „Spektrum“ ist das Bemühen der großen Bandbreite an Symptomen und typischen Besonderheiten sowie den unterschiedlichen Stärken und Fähigkeiten, aber auch den Beeinträchtigungen, die die jeweiligen Menschen mit einer ASS aufweisen können, gerecht zu werden. Dennoch werden derzeit in der klinischen Diagnosestellung nach wie vor folgende Hauptformen einer ASS unterschieden: Frühkindlicher Autismus, Asperger, Atypischer

#### 5.2.2 Attention Deficit Disorders

Attention deficit disorders with hyperactivity (ADHD) are coded as hyperkinetic disorders under the code F90, while under F98, the attention deficit disorders without hyperactivity (ADD) are coded as “other behavioural and emotional disorders”. 

ADHD are characterised by an early onset, usually in the first five years of life, a lack of perseverance in activities that require cognitive effort and a tendency to switch from one activity to another without finishing anything; in addition, there is disorganised, poorly regulated and excessive activity. Various other abnormalities may also be present (see ICD-10, 2024b).

#### 5.2.4 Obesity or Adiposity

According to ICD-10 code E66, obesity or adiposity is a chronic disease characterised by excessive accumulation of fatty tissue in the body. Obesity in childhood and adolescence impairs health and can have increasingly negative consequences into adulthood. 

The main causes of obesity are varied and can be influenced by a combination of factors (e.g., unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, genetics risks, psychosocial factors such as stress and emotional eating, environmental factors such as access to healthy food and safe playgrounds/sports facilities, lack of education/knowledge (see ICD-10, 2024c). 

Overall, as educators, it is important to know or recognise special behaviours and symptoms in order to be able to react early and preventively – also getting in touch with other educator such as parents and therapists. A balanced and positive environment as well as regular exercise and social-educational cooperation are crucial to promote the health of our students.

Please, think about your role as the teacher, your feeling and handling in this situation. Also, reflect why you prefer this or that as a first reaction? You can note other feelings and ideas for re-action on a separate note (sharing with us on the feedback board after finishing this OER).

__Do you often worry about Andy before the sports lesson? If so, how do you want to deal with it? (several options available) __

* Address the child's physical health directly 
* Talk to the parents
* Ignore it/let it come to you
* Talk to colleagues about experiences and methods 
* Talk about the case in your own private environment, seek advice

__Imagine the teams have been chosen and Andy has been picked last and reluctantly by a team. How do you feel as a teacher on a stress scale of 1-5?__

0. my well-being is unrestricted
1. very slightly stressed/stressed
2. slightly stressed/stressed
3. moderately stressed/stressed
4. quite stressed/stressed
5. very stressed/stressed

__Would you keep the team selection method in the future? __

* Yes, a different method would not change the situation for Andy, he will have to put up with it or fight back
* Yes, but I will reprimand the class
* No, I choose a different method? e.g. counting out, drawing lots, ...? 
* No, I avoid team games and only do individual exercises in class

__Imagine Andy is standing in the goal and is insulted by his classmates (“You fill the goal perfectly, very good that you are so fat!”) How do you feel as a teacher on a stress scale of 1-5?__

0. my well-being is unrestricted
1. very slightly stressed/stressed
2. slightly stressed/stressed
3. moderately stressed/stressed
4. quite stressed/stressed
5. very stressed/stressed 

__What feelings do you expect Andy to have when gym class is coming up? Sort the points on a scale according to their strength 0 = not present at all, 1 = very slightly present, .... 5 = very strongly present. __

###	5.3 The Dimension of Personality and Gender

Now, we focus on two popular models of psychology research that describe general structures and characteristics of human personality. Furthermore, we take a closer look on the construct of gender identity.

#### 5.3.1 Universal factors of personality structure

Big-5 Model
---
The Big Five model is examined through an amount of international research. In the 1930s, the development of the model has started with lexical approach studies based on the view that personality traits are reflected in language and that all essential differences between people are already represented in the dictionary by corresponding terms. According to the five factors the model is also called the OCEAN-model:

The __Big Five model__ is examined through an amount of international research. It is also called the OCEAN-model according to the five factors: (see Costa & McCrae, 1988; Costa et al., 2019)[^1][^2]

* __Openness:__ practical, prefers routine, comforting (low score); imaginative, prefers variety, independent (high score)

* __Conscientiousness:__ disorganized, careless, impulsive (low score); organized, careful, disciplined (high score)

* __Extraversion:__ retiring, sober, reserved (low score); sociable, affectionate, fun-loving (high score)

* __Agreeableness:__ ruthless, suspicious, uncooperative (low score); soft-hearted, trusting, helpful (high score)

* __Neuroticism:__ calm, secure, self-satisfied (low score); anxious, insecure, self-pitying (high score) 


HEXACO Model
---

The HEXACO-model includes six factors of human personality structures: __Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience.__ It also based on international research with the lexical approach including several studies in European and Asia areas. The HEXACO model is based on the work of Costa and McCrae's Big Five. However, a significant extension of the HEXACO model is the addition of the dimension Honesty-Humility (Ashton & Lee, 2007; Lee & Ashton, 2008).[^3][^4]

The HEXACO questionnaire is availble in many different languages.[^5]

Model Comparison

The following illustration based on empirical findings shows a comparison (Iller et al., 2021).[^6]

</center>

Being a sensitive teacher, you should be aware of these general, universal factors of personality structure. According to the characteristics, you could be very similar to individual students in your class while your personality could be the opposite to other. 

Try to be aware of your bias and reflect your attitude, because research showed that teacher personality treats effect student learning outcomes (e.g., Hattie, 2012)[^7].

#### 5.3.2 Gender identity

In general, gender refers to the attitudes, feelings, and behaviours that a given culture associates with a person's biological sex (APA, 2012)[^1]. The terms related to gender and sex are often conflated, and the language related to gender identity and sexual orientation has also evolved rapidly.

Gender Identity is a component of gender that describes a person's psychological sense of their gender. Many people describe gender identity as a deeply felt, inherent sense of being a boy, a man, or male; a girl, a woman, or female; or a nonbinary gender (e.g., genderqueer, gender-nonconforming, gender-neutral, agender, gender-fluid) that may or may not correspond to a person's sex assigned at birth, presumed gender based on sex assignment, or primary or secondary sex characteristics. Gender identity applies to all individuals and is not a characteristic only of transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals (APA, 2020)[^2]. 

Looking on educational research, researchers addressed the challenges of exclusion and marginalisation faced by teachers who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT). Whether or not they are open about their orientation, their presence and efforts can have a constructive impact on students' education and development. Lundin (2024)[^3] examined narratives of LGBT teachers and related them to the general functions of education (i.e. qualification, socialisation, subjectification). 

It was found that teachers strive for development and change in order to break _heteronormativity_. That is, policy documents serve as a first step that requires additional comprehensive efforts in schools to address and implement negative attitudes among adults and in the student-teacher relationship. Below, the illustration presented shows the three functions of school education and teachers’ narratives).

Gender identity and heteronormativity
----

IN ARBEIT – habe ich noch nicht geschafft

Transgender-Fallbeispiel:
Sie sind Lehrer*in einer 9. Klasse an einem ländlichen Gymnasium. Es ist Schuljahresbeginn. Sie kommen in eine neue Klasse und erfahren am ersten Tag, dass sich einer der Schüler*innen (Markus), nicht mit seinem biologischen Geschlecht identifiziert. Er kommt aus einer streng religiösen Familie, die keine Transgender akzeptiert. Trotz dieser Erziehung hat Markus in den Sommerferien beschlossen, dass er ab sofort nur noch mit Martina und den weiblichen Pronomen angesprochen werden möchte. Die Eltern akzeptieren die Entscheidung "ihres Jun-gen" nicht, sodass Markus/Martina nicht nur innere Konflikte aufgrund der Religiosität, sondern auch äußere Familienkonflikte hat. Nach den ersten gemeinsamen Schulwochen beobachten Sie als Lehrperson, dass Martina Schwierigkeiten in der Klassengemeinschaft hat und sich zurückzieht. Sie befürchten, dass Martina mit der Situation überfordert ist. Daher gilt es die inneren Konflikte durch die Religion und die familiären Konflikte sowie Konflikte mit Mitschüler*innen zu regulieren, um weitere Probleme wie einen schulischen Leistungsabfall zu vermeiden

#### 5.3.3 Case-vignette 3 "Transgender"

Now, we describe a further, also the last on, case-vignette. Please, take your time and keep in your mind: This is an exercise to think about your role-taking as a teacher in diverse classroom settings; it is not a test for choosing right or wrong answers!

</center>

> __"Transgender" case description:__
>
> You are a 9th grade teacher at a rural high school. It is the beginning of the school year. You join a new class and find out on 
> the first day that one student (Markus) does not identify with his biological gender. He comes from a strictly religious family 
> that does not accept transgender people. Despite this upbringing, Markus decided during the summer vacation that from now on he 
> only wants to be addressed as Martina and the female pronouns. The parents do not accept their son's decision, so Markus/Martina 
> not only has internal conflicts due to his religiousness, but also external family conflicts. 
>
> After the first few weeks of school together, you as a teacher notice that Martina is having difficulties in the class community 
> and is withdrawing. You fear that Martina is overwhelmed by the situation. It is therefore important to regulate the internal 
> conflicts caused by religion and family conflicts as well as conflicts with classmates in order to avoid further problems such as 
> a drop in school performance.

Here, different fields of action are described. Please, think about your role as the teacher in this situation with Markus/Martina. Also, reflect why you prefer this or that as a first reaction? You can note other feelings and ideas for re-action on a separate note (sharing with us on the feedback board after finishing this OER).

__The first field of action concerns your dealings with Martina.__

Choose the option that suits you best. This is about your own assessment.

* I stay out of it and don't talk to Martina about her problems.
* In a conversation with Martina, I refer her to what I think are helpful sources or people to support her.
* I share my own opinion and experiences with Martina.
* Other approach [with text field]

__How do you behave towards Martina?__ 

* I make no active attempts to communicate with Martina.
* I set up a box in which the students can bring concerns to me without having to address me directly. Then I can approach them.
* I speak to Martina directly after the lesson.
* Other approach [with text box]

__How do you deal with other teachers who also teach Martina?__ 

* I don't tell any of my colleagues what I know about Martina's situation.
* I make my colleagues aware that there is a transgender person in the class without saying that it is Martina.
* I tell my colleagues about Martina and her situation.
* Other approach [with text field]

__What do you do regarding the class community?__

* I continue to use the usual social forms and methods.
* I try to use more cooperative social forms and activities that strengthen the class community.
* I make the class aware that Martina should be more integrated.
* Other approach [with text field]

__What is your approach to your future teaching?__

* I follow the curriculum without explicitly addressing the topic of transgender.
* In order to sensitize the class, I combine the topics of the curriculum with the transgender issue.
* I openly discuss Martina's case in front of the class.
* Other approach [with text field]

__How do you deal with the parents?__

* I stay out of it and don't seek contact with the parents. What happens at home is not my responsibility.
* I offer myself in writing as a contact person and provide information about other sources of help.
* I seek direct contact with the parents.
* Other procedure [with text field]

### 5.4 Reducing Bias in Communication

The American Psychological Association (APA) is committed to both the advancement of science and the fair treatment of individuals and groups. “lt is unacceptable to use constructions that might imply prejudicial beliefs or perpetuate biased assumptions against persons on the basis of age, disability, gender, participation in research, racial or ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or some combination of these or other personal factors (e.g., marital status, immigration status, religion). Instead, authors should use affirming and inclusive language.” (APA, 2020, p.131)[^1]. 

For this, the APA Editors have published “Bias-free language guidelines” that helps people around the world in psychology, social work, communications to education to achieve excellence in writing. With regard to bias-free language of teachers in verbal and written communication with students, parents, and other professionals, we assume some of the main ideas the APA (2020) described:

1. Talking about disability Names of conditions such as “Asperger autism” and “Attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity” are more specific than "a student with disability" or “a student with special needs”.

2. Be sensitive to labels Respect the language people use to describe themselves; that is, call people what they call themselves. You may need to ask your students which designations they use. Also, accept that language changes over time and individuals within groups sometimes disagree about the designations they use.

3. Acknowledge people's humanity Ensuring that the individuality and humanity of people are respected. Avoid using adjectives as nouns to label people (e.g., "the gays," "the poor") or labels that equate people with their condition (e.g., "the learning disabled," "the autisms"). Use adjectival forms (e.g., gay men, older adults) or nouns with descriptive phrases (e.g., people living in poverty, people with learning disabilities).

Overall, using a sensitive, bias-free language is important in direct and written communication as well as professional teaching and being a social role model.

###	5.5 Summary Quiz

## 6. Unconsious Bias

![](https://euniwell.de.cool/wp-content/uploads/liascript/images/bias.png)

Why fair decisions are so important in everyday school life: Studies show that unconscious biases, such as a student's name or gender, often flow unnoticed into assessment processes and lead to unfair results (Malouff & Thorsteinsson, 2016).[^1] 

Such biases influence how we perceive and evaluate students - without us realizing it. But it doesn't have to stay that way! Our tool helps you to recognize and reduce these subtle influences so that your decisions remain fair and equitable.

With this self-learning tool, you will expand your knowledge of biases and learn how to minimize them in your everyday school life. Whether you are a (future) teacher, principal or educational staff member - the tool provides practical strategies that you can implement straight away.

In four chapters, you will learn what bias is, where it occurs and how you can make your decision-making more conscious and fairer. Supplemented by practical exercises and reflection tasks, you can integrate what you have learned directly into your everyday teaching.

> __Learning goals__
> 
> * You will learn the basics of unconscious bias.
> * You will find out which biases occur in the school environment.
> * You will learn through practical examples how biases can be avoided.
>
> Duration about 1 hour.

Einleitung
---
Warum faire Entscheidungen im Schulalltag so wichtig sind:
Studien zeigen, dass unbewusste Vorurteile, wie der Name oder das Geschlecht eines Schülers, oft unbemerkt in Bewertungsprozesse einfließen und zu ungerechten Ergebnissen führen (Malouff & Thorsteinsson, 2016). Solche Verzerrungen beeinflussen, wie wir Schüler*innen wahrnehmen und bewerten – ohne dass wir es merken. Doch das muss nicht so bleiben! Unser Tool hilft Ihnen, diese subtilen Einflüsse zu erkennen und gezielt zu reduzieren, damit Ihre Entscheidungen fair und gerecht bleiben.

Mit diesem Selbstlernangebot erweitern Sie Ihr Wissen über Biases und lernen, wie Sie diese in Ihrem Schulalltag minimieren können. Ob als (künftige) Lehrkraft, Schulleitung oder pädagogisches Personal – das Tool vermittelt praxisnahe Strategien, die Sie direkt umsetzen können. 

In vier Kapiteln erfahren Sie, was Bias ist, wo er auftritt und wie Sie Ihre Entscheidungsfindung bewusster und gerechter gestalten. Ergänzt durch praxisnahe Übungen und Reflexionsaufgaben können Sie das Gelernte direkt in Ihren Unterrichtsalltag integrieren.

> __Lernziele__
> 
> * Sie lernen die Grundlagen zum Thema Unconscious Bias.
> * Sie erfahren, welche Biases im schulischen Umfeld auftreten.
> * Sie lernen durch Praxisbeispiele, wie Biases vermieden werden können.

### 6.1 What ist Bias?

The term bias refers to distortions in information processing that influence our perception and decisions. 

There are three main categories of bias:

1. __Preference bias:__ This describes the favoring or disfavoring of certain groups, often based on stereotypes or prejudices (e.g. gender bias). In physics, men are favored, in the social sciences women (Bernstein et al., 2022)[^1]

2. __Structural bias:__ These are institutional patterns that unintentionally promote discrimination. One example is medicine, where drugs are often tested on men, leading to inadequate results for women (Criado-Perez, 2019)[^2]

3. __Cognitive bias:__ This comprises systematic errors in thinking that cloud our judgment, such as confirmation bias. 

    Cognitive biases influence the way in which information is perceived, processed and stored. They arise because our brain processes information selectively in order to make decisions efficiently (Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009)[^3] 
    In doing so, it uses heuristics that are fast but often inaccurate.

    These cognitive biases are based on the dual process model of cognition (Kahneman, 2012)[^4]

    1. __System 1__ works unconsciously and quickly, but is prone to error. ![](47533941cf7f77e451e0d7c737cb9517368a3736.jpg) 

    2. __System 2__ thinks consciously and analytically, but requires more time and energy. ![](ba098658656558e38703a1a390dd018363d87c01.jpg)

    > Bias often occurs in System 1, which processes this information intuitively, while System 2 is more cautious.

In the teaching context, such biases can influence the way teachers perceive and treat students.

In order to minimize biases, reflection and targeted training are necessary. Systematic analyses and organizational measures help to reduce preference and structural biases, while cognitive biases can be reduced through personal reflection and the conscious use of System 2.

#### Deutsch

Der Begriff Bias bezeichnet Verzerrungen in der Informationsverarbeitung, die unsere Wahrnehmung und Entscheidungen beeinflussen. Es gibt drei Hauptkategorien von Bias:

1.	__Präferenzbias: __
Dies beschreibt die Bevorzugung oder Benachteiligung bestimmter Gruppen, oft basierend auf Stereotypen oder Vorurteilen (z. B. Gender Bias). In der Physik werden Männer, in den Sozialwissenschaften Frauen bevorzugt (Bernstein et al., 2022)[^1].

2.	__Struktureller Bias: __
Hierbei handelt es sich um institutionelle Muster, die ungewollt Diskriminierung fördern. Ein Beispiel ist die Medizin, in der Medikamente oft an Männern getestet werden, was zu unzureichenden Ergebnissen für Frauen führt (Criado-Perez, 2019)[^2].

3.	__Kognitiver Bias: __
 
Dieser umfasst systematische Denkfehler, die unser Urteilsvermögen trüben, wie etwa der Bestätigungsfehler. Kognitive Biases beeinflussen die Art und Weise, wie Informationen wahrgenommen, verarbeitet und gespeichert werden. Sie entstehen, weil unser Gehirn Informationen selektiv verarbeitet, um Entscheidungen effizient zu treffen (Gigerenzer & Brighton, 2009)[^3]. Dabei verwendet es Heuristiken, die schnell, aber oft ungenau sind.

Diese kognitiven Verzerrungen basieren auf dem dualen Prozessmodell der Kognition (Kahneman, 2012)[^4]. System 1 arbeitet unbewusst und schnell, ist jedoch fehleranfällig. System 2 denkt bewusst und analytisch, erfordert jedoch mehr Zeit und Energie. Bias tritt oft in System 1 auf, das diese Informationen intuitiv verarbeitet, während System 2 vorsichtiger ist.

Im Lehrkontext können solche Biases die Art beeinflussen, wie Lehrer*innen Schüler*innen wahrnehmen und behandeln. Um Biases zu minimieren, sind Reflexion und gezielte Schulungen notwendig. Systematische Analysen und organisatorische Maßnahmen helfen, Präferenz- und strukturelle Biases zu reduzieren, während kognitive Biases durch persönliche Reflexion und den bewussten Einsatz von System 2 gemindert werden können.

### 6.2 Bias in Information Uptake

Our senses are not perfect tools for perceiving reality. The brain decides which information it processes and blocks out others. In the following we present two examples where you can try it out for yourself

> These examples illustrate that our senses distort information, similar to how cognitive biases influence our decisions.

In the example of motion-induced blindness, our brain deliberately filters out information by ignoring static elements in order to emphasize the moving ones. In contrast, in the case of moving snakes, the brain invents additional movements that do not exist. 

These phenomena exemplify how our perception is distorted by neurological mechanisms. Our brain is limited in its processing capacity and makes quick, often erroneous decisions to prioritize and process information - an important insight when dealing with bias.

Bias in der Informationsaufnahme
Unsere Sinne sind keine perfekten Werkzeuge zur Wahrnehmung der Realität. Das Gehirn entscheidet, welche Informationen es verarbeitet und blendet andere aus. Ein Beispiel dafür ist die bewegungsinduzierte Blindheit. Wenn Sie den grünen Punkt in der untenstehenden Grafik für einige Sekunden fokussieren, werden die gelben, statischen Punkte verschwinden:

Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die optische Täuschung der bewegenden Schlangen. Obwohl das Bild statisch ist, scheint es, als würden sich die Formen bewegen:

Diese Beispiele verdeutlichen, dass unsere Sinne Informationen verzerren, ähnlich wie kognitive Biases unsere Entscheidungen beeinflussen.

Im Beispiel der bewegungsinduzierten Blindheit filtert unser Gehirn bewusst Informationen aus, indem es statische Elemente ignoriert, um die bewegten hervorzuheben. Im Gegensatz dazu erfindet das Gehirn im Fall der bewegenden Schlangen zusätzliche Bewegungen, die nicht existieren. Diese Phänomene zeigen exemplarisch, wie unsere Wahrnehmung durch neurologische Mechanismen verzerrt wird. Unser Gehirn ist in seiner Verarbeitungskapazität begrenzt und trifft schnelle, oft fehlerhafte Entscheidungen, um Informationen zu priorisieren und zu verarbeiten – eine wichtige Erkenntnis im Umgang mit Bias.

### 6.3 Bias in Information Pocessing

In everyday school life, teachers make countless decisions every day - from assessing students' performance to evaluating their behavior. These decisions are often influenced by cognitive biases that we are not aware of. One of these biases is the confirmation bias. 

> Here, people tend to favor information that supports their pre-existing beliefs and opinions (Nickerson, 1998)[^1]. 

This can also happen at school when teachers have positive or negative expectations of a student. Instead of objectively checking whether these expectations are justified, we unconsciously look for information that 
confirms our view and may ignore evidence to the contrary.

A classic example in the school context would be the assessment of a student who is considered gifted in a particular subject. If this student performs mediocre, the confirmation bias could lead the teacher to interpret this performance as exceptional and continue to assume that the student is fundamentally strong in this subject. On the other hand, a student who the teacher believes to be weak in a particular subject could be judged more harshly even if they perform well.

Choice-supportive bias
---

In addition to the confirmation bias, there is also the choice-supportive bias (Lind et al., 2017)[^2], which supports decisions made in retrospect. 

> This means that we tend to positively reinforce decisions we have made - be it the assessment of students or the 
> choice of certain teaching methods - in retrospect. 

For example, after introducing a new teaching method, a teacher may be inclined to perceive this method as more successful than it actually was, simply because they have already chosen it. This can lead to inadequate methods or approaches being retained instead of being critically questioned and adapted.

In-group bias
---

Another important bias that plays a role in schools is the in-group bias (Taylor & Doria, 1981)[^3]. 

> Here, people tend to treat members of their own “group” better than outsiders. 

At school, this could lead to pupils who share similarities with the teacher - be it in terms of origin, interests or personality - being unconsciously favored. This can influence the assessment of performance, but also behavior towards students. Students who are perceived as “outsiders”, on the other hand, may be unconsciously disadvantaged.


Mere-exposure effect
---
There is also the mere-exposure effect. 

> Here, people evaluate other people or things that they encounter more frequently more positively (Serenko & Bontis, 2011)[^4].

In everyday school life, this could mean that teachers perceive students with whom they have more interaction more positively than those who are quieter or more reserved.

Summary
---

These biases are deeply rooted in the way we process information. They occur because our brains need to process complex information quickly and efficiently. Although these mental shortcuts, known as heuristics (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), help us to cope with everyday life, they can lead to unfair judgments in specific situations - especially when it comes to assessing students. The challenge is to become aware of these biases and take action to minimize them.

To counteract these biases, teachers can use various strategies, which we explain in the next chapter.

#### Deutsch

Bias in der Informationsverarbeitung

Im Schulalltag treffen Lehrkräfte täglich unzählige Entscheidungen – von der Einschätzung der Leistung von Schüler*innen bis hin zur Beurteilung ihres Verhaltens. Diese Entscheidungen werden oft von kognitiven Verzerrungen beeinflusst, die uns nicht bewusst sind. Eine dieser Verzerrungen ist der Bestätigungsfehler (Confirmation Bias). Dabei neigen Menschen dazu, Informationen zu bevorzugen, die ihre bereits bestehenden Überzeugungen und Meinungen stützen (Nickerson, 1998). Dies kann auch in der Schule geschehen, wenn Lehrer*innen positive oder negative Erwartungen gegenüber einem Schüler haben. Anstatt objektiv zu prüfen, ob diese Erwartungen gerechtfertigt sind, suchen wir unbewusst nach Informationen, die unsere Sichtweise bestätigen, und ignorieren möglicherweise gegenteilige Hinweise.

Ein klassisches Beispiel im Schulkontext wäre die Beurteilung eines Schülers, der in einem bestimmten Fach als begabt angesehen wird. Wenn dieser Schüler eine mittelmäßige Leistung zeigt, könnte der Bestätigungsfehler dazu führen, dass die Lehrkraft diese Leistung als Ausnahme interpretiert und weiterhin davon ausgeht, dass der Schüler grundsätzlich stark in diesem Fach ist. Andererseits könnte ein Schüler, von dem die Lehrkraft glaubt, dass er schwach in einem bestimmten Fach ist, auch bei guten Leistungen strenger beurteilt werden.

Neben dem Bestätigungsfehler gibt es den choice-supportive bias (Lind et al., 2017), der im Nachhinein getroffene Entscheidungen unterstützt. Dies bedeutet, dass wir dazu neigen, Entscheidungen, die wir getroffen haben – sei es die Bewertung von Schüler*innen oder die Wahl bestimmter Unterrichtsmethoden – rückblickend positiv zu verstärken. Beispielsweise könnte eine Lehrkraft nach der Einführung einer neuen Unterrichtsmethode geneigt sein, diese Methode als erfolgreicher wahrzunehmen, als sie es tatsächlich war, einfach weil sie sich bereits dafür entschieden hat. Dies kann dazu führen, dass unzureichende Methoden oder Ansätze beibehalten werden, anstatt sie kritisch zu hinterfragen und anzupassen.

Ein weiterer wichtiger Bias, der in der Schule eine Rolle spielt, ist der in-group bias (Taylor & Doria, 1981). Hierbei neigen Menschen dazu, Mitglieder der eigenen „Gruppe“ besser zu behandeln als Außenstehende. In der Schule könnte dies dazu führen, dass Schüler*innen, die Ähnlichkeiten mit der Lehrkraft teilen – sei es in Bezug auf Herkunft, Interessen oder auch Persönlichkeit – unbewusst bevorzugt werden. Dies kann die Beurteilung von Leistungen, aber auch das Verhalten gegenüber Schüler*innen beeinflussen. Schüler*innen, die als „Außenseiter“ wahrgenommen werden, könnten hingegen unbewusst benachteiligt werden.
Daneben gibt es noch den Mere-Exposure-Effekt, der beschreibt, dass wir Menschen oder Dinge, denen wir häufiger begegnen, positiver bewerten (Serenko & Bontis, 2011). Im Schulalltag könnte dies bedeuten, dass Lehrkräfte Schüler*innen, mit denen sie mehr Interaktion haben, positiver wahrnehmen als jene, die stiller oder zurückhaltender sind.

Diese Biases sind tief in unserer Art, Informationen zu verarbeiten, verwurzelt. Sie treten auf, weil unser Gehirn komplexe Informationen schnell und effizient verarbeiten muss. Diese mentalen Abkürzungen, sogenannte Heuristiken (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973), helfen uns zwar, den Alltag zu meistern, können aber in spezifischen Situationen zu ungerechten Urteilen führen – besonders wenn es um die Beurteilung von Schüler*innen geht. Die Herausforderung besteht darin, sich dieser Verzerrungen bewusst zu werden und Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um sie zu minimieren.
Um diesen Verzerrungen entgegenzuwirken, können Lehrkräfte verschiedene Strategien anwenden, die wir im nächsten Kapitel erläutern.

### 6.4 Minimize Bias in Decision-making

Although knowledge of bias is important, it is not enough to avoid these biases (Bezrukova et al., 2016; Devine & Ash, 2021)[^1][^2]. This is because bias is often automatically activated by our fast decision-making system, System 1. To minimize bias, it is important to consciously activate System 2, but this can be exhausting and time-consuming. Nevertheless, there are practical steps to reduce bias in decision-making - especially in the school context, where fair assessments of students are important.

One effective method is bias reduction, in which bias is systematically minimized through structured processes. Examples of this in everyday school life are

* Anonymization of exams: If teachers do not know the names of students, the halo or horn effect, where previous performance could influence the assessment, is reduced.

* Elimination of irrelevant information: When evaluating performance, irrelevant information such as personal bias should not be included. Avoiding bias due to characteristics such as origin or gender can reduce in-group bias.

* Use clear evaluation criteria: Structured and pre-defined criteria, such as for oral exams or project work, help to minimize subjective assessments. By defining clear benchmarks (e.g. on a scale from A to C or 1 to 6), it can be ensured that the assessment is more objective and that there is less room for bias.

Group decisions at school
----

Many important decisions in everyday school life - such as performance assessments or support measures - are made in groups. Such decisions are particularly susceptible to distortions such as social desirability bias or the influence of information cascades. These arise when influential group members express an opinion that others follow uncritically. In a teacher conference, this could mean that the opinion of an experienced teacher unconsciously influences everyone else, even if they originally disagreed. Kahneman et al. (2021)[^3] have coined the term “decision hygiene”, which describes strategies to reduce such biases in groups. This includes measures such as:

* Independent judgments: Group members should only express their opinions once they have made their decisions independently. This avoids cascading effects.

* Anonymous voting: To reduce social desirability bias, decisions should be made as anonymously as possible. This prevents individuals from changing their minds for social reasons just to suit the group.

* Clear evaluation criteria and structured discussions: To avoid group polarization, discussions should be clearly structured and moderated. Groups tend to reinforce their opinions in discussions, which can lead to more extreme decisions than originally planned.

Practical steps for everyday school life
---

To reduce bias in the school decision-making process, several steps are useful:

1. use pre-defined criteria: Criteria should be defined before a decision is made and only consider relevant aspects of student performance.

2. use assessment guidelines: Structured guides, especially for oral exams or project assessments, help to minimize subjective bias.

3. enable independent assessments: Individual assessments should be completed prior to group sharing to minimize the influence of social dynamics.

4. subsequent reflection: After making a decision, teachers should consciously take time to question their own decision and reflect on possible biases. This can be supported in peer groups or through coaching.

Conclusion
---
Bias in decision-making can be effectively minimized through structured processes, clear criteria and the reduction of social influence factors - an approach that ensures greater fairness both in individual performance and in group decisions in the school context.

#### Deutsch

Obwohl das Wissen über Bias wichtig ist, reicht es nicht aus, um diese Verzerrungen zu vermeiden (Bezrukova et al., 2016; Devine & Ash, 2021). Dies liegt daran, dass Bias oft automatisch durch unser schnelles Entscheidungssystem, das System 1, aktiviert wird. Um Verzerrungen zu minimieren, ist es wichtig, System 2 bewusst zu aktivieren, was jedoch anstrengend und zeitaufwändig sein kann. Dennoch gibt es praktische Schritte, um Bias in der Entscheidungsfindung zu reduzieren – gerade im schulischen Kontext, wo es um faire Beurteilungen von Schüler*innen geht.

Eine effektive Methode ist die Bias Reduction, bei der Verzerrungen systematisch durch strukturierte Prozesse minimiert werden. Beispiele hierfür im Schulalltag sind:

* Anonymisierung von Prüfungen: Wenn Lehrer*innen die Namen von Schüler*innen nicht kennen, wird der Halo- oder Horn-Effekt reduziert, bei dem frühere Leistungen die Bewertung beeinflussen könnten.

* Eliminierung irrelevanter Informationen: Bei der Bewertung von Leistungen sollten keine irrelevanten Informationen wie z. B. persönliche Vorurteile einfließen. Das Vermeiden von Voreingenommenheit durch Merkmale wie Herkunft oder Geschlecht kann den In-Group-Bias reduzieren.

* Verwendung klarer Bewertungskriterien: Strukturierte und vorher festgelegte Kriterien, etwa bei mündlichen Prüfungen oder Projektarbeiten, helfen, subjektive Einschätzungen zu minimieren. Durch die Definition klarer Maßstäbe (z. B. auf einer Skala von A bis C oder 1 bis 6) kann sichergestellt werden, dass die Bewertung objektiver erfolgt und weniger Raum für Bias besteht.

Gruppenentscheidungen in der Schule
----

Viele wichtige Entscheidungen im Schulalltag – wie z. B. Leistungsbeurteilungen oder Fördermaßnahmen – werden in Gruppen getroffen. Solche Entscheidungen sind besonders anfällig für Verzerrungen wie den Social Desirability Bias oder den Einfluss von Informationskaskaden. Diese entstehen, wenn einflussreiche Gruppenmitglieder eine Meinung äußern, der andere unkritisch folgen. In einer Lehrerkonferenz könnte dies bedeuten, dass die Meinung einer erfahrenen Lehrkraft unbewusst alle anderen beeinflusst, auch wenn diese ursprünglich anderer Meinung waren.
Kahneman et al. (2021) haben den Begriff „Entscheidungshygiene“ geprägt, der Strategien beschreibt, um solche Verzerrungen in Gruppen zu reduzieren. Dazu gehören Maßnahmen wie:

* Unabhängige Urteile: Gruppenmitglieder sollten ihre Meinungen erst dann äußern, wenn sie ihre Entscheidungen unabhängig getroffen haben. Dadurch werden Kaskadeneffekte vermieden.

* Anonyme Abstimmungen: Um den Social Desirability Bias zu verringern, sollten Entscheidungen möglichst anonym getroffen werden. Dies verhindert, dass Einzelpersonen aus sozialen Gründen ihre Meinung ändern, nur um der Gruppe zu 
entsprechen.

* Klare Bewertungskriterien und strukturierte Diskussionen: Um Gruppenpolarisierungen zu vermeiden, sollten Diskussionen klar strukturiert und moderiert werden. Gruppen neigen dazu, ihre Meinungen in Diskussionen zu verstärken, was zu extremeren Entscheidungen führen kann, als ursprünglich geplant.

Praktische Schritte für den Schulalltag
---

Um Verzerrungen im schulischen Entscheidungsprozess zu reduzieren, sind mehrere Schritte sinnvoll:

1.	Vorab festgelegte Kriterien verwenden: Kriterien sollten vor einer Entscheidung definiert werden und nur die relevanten Aspekte der Schülerleistungen berücksichtigen.

2.	Bewertungsleitfäden verwenden: Strukturierte Leitfäden, besonders bei mündlichen Prüfungen oder Projektbeurteilungen, helfen, subjektive Verzerrungen zu minimieren.

3.	Unabhängige Beurteilungen ermöglichen: Vor dem Austausch in der Gruppe sollten individuelle Bewertungen abgeschlossen sein, um den Einfluss sozialer Dynamiken zu minimieren.

4.	Nachträgliche Reflexion: Nach der Entscheidungsfindung sollten sich Lehrkräfte bewusst Zeit nehmen, um die eigene Entscheidung zu hinterfragen und mögliche Biases zu reflektieren. Dies kann in Peer-Gruppen oder durch Coaching unterstützt werden.
Fazit
Durch strukturierte Prozesse, klare Kriterien und die Reduzierung sozialer Einflussfaktoren kann Bias in der Entscheidungsfindung effektiv minimiert werden – ein Ansatz, der sowohl in der Einzelleistung als auch in Gruppenentscheidungen im Schulkontext für mehr Fairness sorgt.
